            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Anifold (right Worſhipfull) and moſt daungerous are the temptations and aſſaults of our ſpirituall enemies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they labour to hinder the ſaluation of Gods elect, and to increaſe the greatneſſe of their helliſh dominions, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing (if it were poſſible) Gods ſeruants from their ſubiection and alleageance, and making them their ſlaues and perpetuall vaſſals. To this end they take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable paines, going continually about ſeeking whom they may deuour; ſometimes like roaring Lions, compelling by violent force, and ſometimes
<pb facs="tcp:23802:3"/>like old Serpents, alluring and deceiuing with trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous policies. Neither doe they reſt in the time of our reſt, but waking and ſleeping they ſet vpon vs, one while inticing vs to ſwallow the poyſon of ſinne, with the ſugred baites of worldly vanities, and another while driuing vs into their ſnares of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, with the ſharpe pricking goades of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and affliction. Before vs they ſet carnall pleaſures, deceiuing riches, and vaine honours, to allure vs to come into the broad way that leadeth to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and behind vs they hold the three-ſtringed whip of loſſe, ſhame, and puniſhment, to keepe vs from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backe, and to haſten vs with winged ſpeede to run forward in this helliſh iourney. Neither do they greatly care what path we chuſe in this common way of perdition; whether the ſpatious way of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and preſumption, or the ſtrait path of horror and deſperation, whether the toyling way of vnſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able couetouſneſſe, or the ſoft faire way of bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſures, whether the open way of worldlineſſe and atheiſme, or through the hidden thickets of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and diſſimulation: in a word they regard not in what way we walke, ſo we goe forward in the waies of ſinne, for though they ſeeme diuers and contrarie one to another, yet they haue all the ſame end, meeting together in hell and deſtruction. And howſoeuer they cannot with all their malice, power and policies attaine vnto their deſires, by bringing Gods elect and faithfull ones to perdition and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe miſerie; becauſe God their heauenly father who hath taken vpon him their protection, fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all their ſubtill policies with his all-ſeeing wife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and withſtandeth all their might with his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
<pb facs="tcp:23802:3"/>power, yet doe they exceedingly with their aſſaults and temptations, foyle, vexe and trouble them; by working in ſome, forgetfulneſſe of God and of themſelues, ſecuritie, and careleſſe retchleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and turmoyling others with horrible feares, deſperat doubting, and bitter agonies. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that the one ſort ſecurely goe on in ſinne, forgetting the end of their creation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and holy vocation, vnto which God hath called them, vntill with <hi>Salomon</hi> they haue found in the end of their worldly delights, nothing but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vexation of ſpirit: and the other are ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, aſtoniſhed, and continually tormented with doubtings, feares, and the continuall aſſaults of their ſpirituall enemies, that they goe mourning all the day long, pining away in griefe and anguiſh of mind, till at laſt they grow wearie of their liues, thinking their ſoules an intollerable burthen to their bodies, and their bodies to the earth. The conſideration of which lamentable and too too miſerable effects, as it ſhall moue all chriſtians to ſtand vpon their guard, and to arme themſelues with the ſpirituall armour, that they may not be ouercome of their temptations, and fall into theſe great miſchiefes: ſo ſhould it moue Gods faithfull miniſters (whoſe dutie it is, not onely themſelues to walke in the waies of righteouſneſſe, but alſo as ſpirituall guides to leade others with them) in diſcharge of their conſcience before God, and in chriſtian commiſeration and compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their brethren, to vſe all good meanes both by ſpeaking and writing, whereby they may bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued and freed from theſe ſnares which their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemies doe lay to intrap them; by beating
<pb facs="tcp:23802:4"/>downe with the cannon-ſhot of Gods threatnings, the high forts of their proud preſumption, and rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them out of the deepe ſlumber of retchleſſe ſecuritie; as alſo by raiſing vp and comforting thoſe that mourne in Syon, ſtooping, yea lying groueling vnder the heauie burthen of their ſinnes. The which howſoeuer it is performed by many, in reſpect of their ſeuerall charges committed to them; and ſome alſo haue briefely touched ſome poynts in writing, which concerned the comforting and raiſing vp of their priuate friends: yet not any (that I know of) haue in our language largely and generally handled theſe controuerſies, and ſpirituall conflicts betweene the chriſtian and the enemies of his ſaluation, for the common good of the whole Church. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing with <hi>Elihu</hi> long waited to ſee if thoſe who were more auncient, better experienced, and more richly furniſhed with Gods gifts and graces than my ſelfe, would vndertake this worke, which is to God moſt acceptable, and to his ſaints and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſo profitable and neceſſarie: at length after others long ſilence, I reſolued to ſpeake, and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to conceale ſuch true comforts as God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto me; to the end that hereby I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and comfort thoſe who are poore in ſpirit, and humbled in the ſight of ſinne; or at leaſt by offering willingly to this vſe my ſmall mite, I might giue an occaſion vnto others better able, to vnlocke and open their rich treaſuries, that they may beſtow vpon their poore brethren their great talents and gifts of better valew. The which my labors as I did not raſhly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake them, ſo I haue not ſuddenly finiſhed them; for almoſt three yeeres ſince I purpoſed to take this
<pb facs="tcp:23802:4"/>worke in hand, which I haue now by Gods aſſiſtance finiſhed; but at the firſt (I confeſſe) I intended not that it ſhould come in to publike view; but onely (as others before me) propounded as the end of my labours, the comforting and raiſing vp of a moſt faithfull ſeruant of God, and my moſt deare friend, who hath bound me with many benefits to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all chriſtian duties. But afterwards fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it to grow to ſuch a volume that it was too great to paſſe in a written coppie, and hoping that that which was profitable for one might bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall vnto many, at length I reſolued to make my labours publike by committing them to the preſſe. The principall things that I propounded to my ſelfe in this treatiſe are theſe; firſt and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally I indeauour to comfort thoſe who are afflicted in conſcience, in the ſight and ſence of their ſinnes, by offering vnto them certaine aſſurance, that their ſinnes are remitted, and that themſelues are elected to eternall life, in the ſtate of grace, reconciled vnto God in Chriſt and receiued in his loue and fauour. Secondly, I labour to leade the chriſtian in an euen courſe, vnto the hauen of eternall happineſſe; that he may not runne aſide, neither on the right hand, and ſo falling vpon the rockes of preſumption make ſhipwracke of his ſoule, nor yet on the left hand, and ſo plunge himſelfe into the gulfe of deſperation. Wherein I haue purpoſely and aduiſedly auoyded their practiſe, who ſcatter their conſolations they know not where, to bee applyed they care not by whom; whereof it commeth to paſſe that thoſe that are moſt ſecure and preſumptuous arrogate them, to whom they doe not appertaine; and thoſe that
<pb facs="tcp:23802:5"/>are afflicted and humbled dare not appropriate them to themſelues, becauſe they are deliuered indefinitly to all, without all caution or any condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might bee reſtrai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed rather to them than any other in whom ſinne yet liueth and raigneth. Wherein they reſemble negligent phyſitions, who hauing made a good medicine for a ſicke man, doe not giue it vnto him, but caſt it careleſly into ſome corner, whether the ſicke patient in reſpect of his faintneſſe and weakeneſſe is likely neuer to come: which being found and greedily drunken vp by thoſe who haue no neede of it, in ſtead of doing them good doth turne to their baine and vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Laſtly, I haue deſired to giue ſolid and ſubſtantiall conſolations, which are firmely groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon Gods vndoubted truth, and ſuch infallible reaſons as cannot bee gainſaid; and haue withall deliuered the conditions, vpon which they are to be receiued, and the vndoubted ſignes and markes of thoſe, to whom of right they appertaine; to the end that thoſe who finde theſe things in themſelues, may not doubt to apply them to their wounded conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, whereby they may bee ſoundly cured and throughly comforted; and that thoſe who finde no ſuch condition obſerued by them, nor any ſuch ſigne or marke in them, may be debarred from participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of theſe conſolations, which would nouriſh in them ſecuritie and preſumption: and contrariwiſe examining themſelues according to theſe rules, and finding no correſpondencie betweene themſelues and them, may hereby be awakened out of their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie of ſecuritie, and attaining vnto a ſight and ſenſe of their miſerable eſtate may neuer be at reſt,
<pb facs="tcp:23802:5"/>till by vſing all good meanes for this purpoſe, they may finde theſe markes and ſignes of their election, vocation, iuſtification, and ſanctification in them, that ſo they may boldly and fitly apply vnto themſelues theſe comforts and conſolations as rightly and truly appertaining vnto them. All which my labours I thought good to dedicate vnto your worſhips, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe I deſired to giue this teſtimonie of my true thankefulneſſe, for thoſe manifold benefits which from ſome of you I haue receiued, and of mine vnfained loue which I beare to you all, for your vertues and approued godlineſſe; and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I thought none fitter to whom I might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this diſcourſe of the <hi>Chriſtian Warfare,</hi> than your ſelues who are olde experienced ſouldiars in fighting theſe ſpirituall battailes, and therefore haue iudiciall feeling and ſenſible apprehenſion, of thoſe things which I haue written and commended to your patronage. Now the Lord our God who is the fountaine of all goodneſſe, and the ſole giuer of all true conſolation, increaſe in you more and more the gifts and graces of his ſanctifying ſpirit, and ſo fill your hearts with all ſound ſpirituall comfort, and the ioy in the holy Ghoſt, that you may through the courſe of your whole liues, chearefully goe forward in the profeſſion and ſincere practiſe of his religion and true godlineſſe, and after this life may receiue that crowne of righteounſneſſe, which is prepared and laid vp for you in his kingdome of eternall glorie. <hi>Amen.</hi>

The ſpirituall Cananites are quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and they remember not the bleſſed land of promiſe, whereunto like pilgrimes they ſhould bee trauailing, but make this world, this wildernes of ſin, the place of their ioy and delight. In a word, they flouriſh in their outward ſtates, and neuer in their mindes feele any vexation of Sathans tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. And what is the cauſe of all this?

And not content with theſe bragges of their owne happie eſtate, they cenſure and condemne Gods children, accounting their ſtate moſt deſperate who are moleſted with

But let ſuch men know that of all others their ſtate is moſt daungerous, for they are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly ſicke, and haue no ſenſe of their diſeaſe, their wounds are ſo mortall that they depriue them of all feeling; they are aſſaulted, yea taken priſoners whileſt they ſleepe ſoundly in ſecuritie, and diſcerne not the approch of the enemie. <hi>Non ergo repugnant quia ſe impugnari ignorant:</hi> They make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance becauſe they are ignorant of the aſſault.

So that when we are thus tempted and aſſaulted by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, the world, and our corrupt fleſh, it is a ſtrong argument to perſwade vs that wee are intertained for Gods ſouldiers, and haue receiued the preſſe money of his ſpirit; for Sathans kingdome is not diuided, neither doth he fight againſt thoſe who are his friends and ſeruants, but againſt thoſe who wage warre againſt him and fight vnder the Lords ſtanderd. True it is, that when his ſeruants haue committed ſuch abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and grieuous ſinnes, as haue made deepe wounds in their ſeared conſciences, whereby they are awakened out of their ſleepie lethargie of ſecuritie, then Sathan filleth them with horrour and deſpaire, that hee may keepe them from true repentance, when he can hide from them their ſinnes no longer; and the Lord in his iuſt iudgement, and for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others, doth ſuffer Sathan to begin in them the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell in this life; but if hee can by any meanes hide

Let all thoſe therefore who feele the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of their ſinnes, and are vexed with the continuall aſſaults of their ſpirituall enemies comfort themſelues; for hereby they haue aſſurance that they are members of the Church militant, into which none but ſouldiers are intertained, and that now they begin to be Gods friends and ſeruants when as Sathan oppoſeth himſelfe againſt them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Why God ſuffereth his ſeruants to be exerciſed in the ſpirituall conflict of tentations.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt here it may be demaunded, why the Lord will ſuffer his ſeruants to be thus tempted and aſſaulted, whereas the wicked are free from ſuch conflicts. I anſwere, firſt for his owne glorie, for whereas our enemies are ſtrong and mighty and we weake and feeble, hereby is the Lords omnipotent power manifeſted to all the world, by whoſe aſſiſtance ſuch impotent wretches conquer and ſubdue ſuch furious and puiſſant enemies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God ſuffereth his children to be tempted, that ſo thoſe ſpirituall graces which he hath beſtowed vpon them may the more cleerely ſhine to his glorie. For who can know whether they be Gods golden veſſels before they be brought to the touchſtone of temptation? Who could know the faith, patience and valour of Gods ſouldiers, if they alwaies lay quietly in garriſon and neuer came to the skirmiſh? Who could feele the odoriferous ſmell of theſe aromaticall ſpices, if they were not punned and bruſed in the morter of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? For example, who would haue diſcerned <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, <hi>Dauids</hi> pietie, <hi>Iobs</hi> patience, <hi>Pauls</hi> courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, if they had been neuer tempted, which now to the glorie of God ſhine to all the world?</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:23802:15"/>
               <p>And as the Lord ſuffereth Sathan and his impes to trie his children for his owne glorie, ſo alſo for their ſpirituall and euerlaſting good: for firſt hereby he chaſtizeth them for their ſinnes paſt, and recalleth them to their remembrance, that ſo they may truly repent of them. And this cauſe <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh of:<note place="margin">Iob. 13.26.</note> Iob. 13.26. <hi>Thou writeſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>bitter things againſt me, and makeſt me to poſſeſſe the iniquities of my youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, hereby hee manifeſteth vnto vs our ſecret and hidden ſinnes, which the blind eyes of our iudgement would not diſcerne, if their ſight were not quickned with this ſharp water of temptation. For ſo long as wee liue in peace, our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure conſciences neuer ſummon vs to the barre of Gods iudgement; but when wee are rouſed vp by temptation, wee enter into a more ſtraight examination of our ſelues, and ſearch what ſecret ſinnes lie lurking in the hidden corners of our hearts, that ſo wee may repent of them and make our peace with God, without whoſe aſſiſtance wee can haue no hope to ſtand in any temptation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord hereby preuenteth our ſinnes to come: for when we haue experience, that the moſt ſharp weapons, which Sathan vſeth to inflict deepe wounds in our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are our ſinnes; this will make vs moſt carefull to abſtaine from them, leaſt thereby we ſtrengthen him for our owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow. And as theſe temptations of Sathan are in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſo many bridles to reſtraine vs from ſinne; ſo alſo they are ſo many prickes to let out the winde of vaine glorie, wherewith like bladders we be puffed vp, as wee may ſee in the example of <hi>Paul, who leſt he ſhould be exalted out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure through the abundance of reuelations, receiued a pricke in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Sathan to buffet him.</hi> 2. Cor. 12.7.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">2. Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12.7.</note> the Lord ſuffereth Sathan to aſſault vs, that wee may hereby come to the fight of our owne weakneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, when wee haue receiued many foiles; and learne to relie vpon his helpe and aſſiſtance in all our dangers; for ſo proud we are by nature, that before we come to the fight we think that we can repell the ſtrongeſt aſſaults, and ouercome all enemies which oppoſe themſelues againſt vs by our owne power; but when wee ſee our ſelues vanquiſhed and foiled
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23802:15"/>with euery ſmall temptation, wee learne to haue a more humble conceit of our owne abilitie, and to depend wholy vpon the Lord. And this end is ſet downe, Deut. 8.2. and 13.3.<note place="margin">Deut. 8.2. and 13.3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, the Lord permitteth Sathan continually to aſſaile vs with his temptations, to the end we may continually buckle vnto vs the whole armour of God, that we may be readie for the battaile. For as thoſe who haue no enemies to encounter them, caſt their armour aſide and let it ruſt, becauſe they are ſecure from daunger; but when the enemies are at hand and ſound the alarum, they both wake and ſleepe in their armour readie for the aſſault: ſo, if we ſhould not continually skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh with our ſpirituall enemies, we would lay aſide the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall armour; but when wee haue continuall vſe of it, both day and night we keepe it faſt buckled vnto vs, that being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at all points, we may be able to make reſiſtance that we be not ſurpriſed at vnawares.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, by this conflict the Lord ſtrengthneth and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all his graces in vs: for as by exerciſe the ſtrength of the body is preſerued and augmented, and in ſhort time decaieth through idleneſſe and ſloth; ſo the gifts of Gods ſpirit, faith, affiance, hope, patience and the reſt languiſh in vs, if they bee not exerciſed with temptations.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.3.4.</note> 
                  <hi>For tribulation bringeth forth patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not aſhamed,</hi> as it is Rom. 5.3, 4, 5. For when once wee haue been tempted and tried, and the Lord hath mercifullie deliuered vs from the temptation, afterwards being ſo aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wee patiently endure it, hoping for the Lords aſſiſtance,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 17.37. Pſal. 27.9.</note> beleeuing and aſſuring our ſelues that the Lord who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vs will againe deliuer vs, as it is Pſal. 27.9. Moreouer, when wee ſee the great neede of the graces of Gods ſpirit, this will be a ſtrong motiue to intice vs to a carefull vſe of all good meanes whereby we may attaine vnto them, whereas if we were free from this ſpirituall conflict, we ſhould not ſo cleerely ſee nor apprehend the vſe and neceſſitie of them.</p>

The firſt is the iuſtneſſe of our cauſe. For though ſouldiers be neuer ſo ſtrong and well furniſhed, yet if their conſciences tell them that they fight in a bad quarrell, it will much abate their courage, and make them cowardly and timorous. But our cauſe is moſt iuſt, and our warre moſt lawfull, for God who is iuſtice it ſelfe hath proclaimed it by his Heraulds the Apoſtles.<note place="margin">Eph. 6.10.</note> So Ephe. 6.10. <hi>Finally my brethren be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</hi> 11. <hi>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand against the aſſaults of the diuell,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The cauſe of our ſpirituall warre of great importance.</note>Secondly, the cauſe of our warre is of great waight, as namely for the glory of God and our owne ſaluation; for in all ſathans skirmiſhes, he ſeeketh to impeach Gods glory with falſe imputations, and to bring vs to vtter deſtruction. And this may appeare by his firſt conflict with our mother <hi>Eue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.4.5.</note> Gen. 3.4.5. where he accuſeth God of a lye, who is truth it ſelfe; and of impotencie and enuious diſdaine, ſaying, that the cauſe why he did forbid them to cate of the fruite of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill, was not (as he had ſaid) becauſe they ſhould die, but becauſe he knew that when they ſhould eate thereof, their eyes ſhould be opened, and they ſhould be as Gods knowing good and euill. Where firſt he ſeeketh to dimme the beames of Gods glorie by accuſing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23802:16"/>him of a lie, and to perſwade them that he was not omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſeeing that he was not able to hinder them from being Gods, if they taſted of this fruite: laſtly, that he therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad them to eate thereof, becauſe he enuied them ſo glorious an eſtate. And ſecondly he laboureth to deſtroy our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents both bodie and ſoule, by tempting them to diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and the tranſgreſſion of Gods commandement: and therefore our Sauiour Chriſt Ioh. 8.44. doth very fitly ioyne theſe two together, ſaying,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.44.</note> that he was a liar and a manſlaier from the beginning. A liar, in that he falſely accuſed God of lying; a manſlaier, becauſe he did it to this end, that he might murther our firſt parents and all their poſteritie both bodie and ſoule. So that you ſee that the end of Sathans fight is to diſhonour God and deſtroy vs, and therefore if wee haue any regard of Gods glorie (which ſhould be more deare vnto vs then our owne ſoules) or any reſpect of our owne ſaluation, if we would not treacherouſly betray them both by our ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes or cowardize into the hands of Gods and our enemie; let vs valiantly enter the field, and neuer ceaſe our couragious fight till we haue obtained a full victorie.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>2</label> The ſecond reaſon to moue vs to vndertake this fight is the profit which will accrew vnto vs thereby: <note place="margin">The profit of this ſpirituall fight.</note> for if the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſome bootie and prize, or the receiuing of ſome trife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling pay will moue the ſouldiers of earthly Princes to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe all daungers, and with wonderfull perill of life to fight euen at the Cannons mouth; how much more ſhould the ſtipend of our heauenly king moue vs to fight this combat how terrible ſoeuer it ſeemeth to fleſh and bloud? For firſt that is truly here verified, <hi>Pax belli filia,</hi> Peace is the daughter of warre, neither can we ſooner enter the field to fight againſt theſe enemies, but preſently we ſhall haue peace with God, and ſoone after the fruite thereof the peace of conſcience. Whereas if we betray Gods cauſe to Sathan and our ſoules to ſinne, well may wee be lulled aſleepe in carnall ſecuritie, but we ſhall neuer enioy this peace with God and peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: for <hi>there is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> Eſa. 57.

                  <note place="margin">Promiſes made to thoſe that fight. <hi>Apoc. 2. &amp; 3.</hi>
                  </note>Secondly, if wee fight againſt theſe enemies and valiantly ouercome, the Lord hath promiſed to giue vs to eate of the tree of life which is in Paradice, and the Manna that is hid, and that he will write our names in the booke of life, Apoc. 2 and 3. that is, he will in this life beſtow on vs all his ſpirituall graces, and in the life to come repleniſh vs with ſuch <hi>ioyes as neither eye hath ſeene,</hi>

Let vs therefore ſtriue that wee may ouercome, <hi>Nam breuis eſt labor, praemium verò aeternum:</hi> Our labour is but ſhort, but our reward ſhall be eternall. On the other ſide, if wee conſider Sathans pay which he giueth vnto his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, we ſhall finde that it is nothing but the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, and in the end euerlaſting death and deſtruction of bodie and ſoule: <hi>For the wages of ſinne is death,</hi> as it is Rom. 6.23.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>3</label> The third reaſon to moue vs to this fight, <note place="margin">The honor that will accompany our victorie.</note> is the honour which will accompanie this victorie: for if earthly ſouldiers will purchaſe honour with the loſſe of life, which is nothing els but the commendation of the Prince, or applauſe of the vaine people; what hazard ſhould we not vndergo in fighting the ſpirituall combat, ſeeing our grand Captaine the Lord of hoaſts, &amp; infinite multitudes of bleſſed Angels look vpon vs and behold our combat, whoſe praiſe and approbation is our chiefe felicitie? What peril ſhould we feare, to obtaine a crowne of glorie which is promiſed to all that ouercome, and to become heires apparant of Gods kingdome? On the other ſide, the ſhame and confuſion of face which ſhall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them who cowardly forſake the Lords ſtanderd and yeeld vnto Sathan, when as they ſhall not dare to looke the Lord in the face whoſe cauſe they haue betrayed, ſhould
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23802:17"/>ſerue as a ſtrong motiue to encourage vs to the fight.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>4</label> The fourth reaſon to perſwade vs, <note place="margin">The neceſſitie of vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</note> is the neceſſitie of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking this combat. There is no man ſo cowardly that wil not fight when there is no hope in flight, no mercie to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in the enemie, no outrage and crueltie which will not be committed. But ſuch is our enemie that we cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie flee from him, his malice is vnreconcilable, his crueltie outragious, for hee fighteth not againſt vs to the end that hee may obtaine ſoueraigntie alone, abridge vs of our libertie, ſpoyle vs of our goods; but he aimeth at our death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of bodie and ſoule: if therefore wee ſo carefully arme our ſelues againſt carthly enemies, who when they haue done their vttermoſt rage can but ſhorten a miſerable life, how much more carefully ſhould we reſiſt this enemie, who ſeeketh to depriue vs of euerlaſting life, and to plunge vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an euerdying death?</p>
               <p>Secondly, this fight is neceſſarie, becauſe in our Baptiſme we haue taken a militarie ſacrament, and promiſed faithfullie vnto the Lord, that wee will continue his faithfull ſouldiers vnto the end, fighting his battailes againſt the fleſh, the world and the diuell. There wee haue giuen our names vnto Chriſt, to whom wee owe our ſelues and liues by a double right, both becauſe he hath giuen them vnto vs, and alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored them the ſecond time when wee had loſt them. There wee are put in minde of his bloudſhed for our redemption, which ſhould encourage vs to fight couragiouſly, that wee may be preſerued from falling againe into the cruell ſlauerie of ſinne and Sathan.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, vnleſſe wee fight this ſpirituall combat, and in fighting ouercome, wee ſhall neuer be crowned with the crown of glory: for it is not giuen vnto any to triumph, who haue not fought valiantly and ſubdued their enemies. The euerlaſting peace of Gods kingdome is not promiſed to ſuch cowards as neuer entred the field, or being entred haue preſently yeelded themſelues to be the captiues of Sathan: but vnto thoſe that fight couragiouſly and gloriouſly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. <hi>If any man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſtriue for a maisterie, he is not crowned except he ſtriue as he ought to doe,</hi> 2. Tim. 2.5. So
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23802:18"/>the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> chap. 1. verſ. 12. pronounceth the man <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that endureth tentation; for when he is tried</hi> (or rather as the words are, when by triall he ſhall be found approued) <hi>he ſhall receiue a crowne of life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that loue him.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that none are crowned vnleſſe they ſtriue as they ought, and therefore much leſſe they which ſtriue not at all; that none are bleſſed but thoſe who are tempted, and being tempted endure the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that firſt we muſt be tried, and by triall approoued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were we can receiue the crowne of life.</p>

He hath bruſed the ſerpents head, ſo that he ſhall not be able to ouercome the leaſt of his followers, well may he hiſſe againſt them, but he cannot hurt them, for his ſting is taken away. Sathan was the ſtrong man who poſſeſſed all in peace, but our Sauiour Chriſt who was a ſtronger then he, comming vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him hath ouercome him, and taken from him all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour wherein he truſted and diuided his ſpoiles, Luk. 11.21, 22. We fought againſt mightie enemies and great poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, Eph. 66.12. but our Sauiour hath <hi>ſpoiled principalities and powers, and hath made a ſhew of them openly, and hath triumphed ouer them vpon the croſſe,</hi> Col. 2.15. <hi>and ſo through death hath deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is the diuell, that he might deliuer all them which for feare of death were all their life ſubiect to bondage,</hi> as it is Heb. 2.14, 15. He was indeede a mightie prince of this worldly Canaan,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 10.24.25</note> but our good <hi>Ioſhua</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:23802:18"/>hath ſubdued him, and hath left nothing for vs to doe who are his ſouldiers and followers, but to tread in his necke in token of victorie. But we alas are faint-harted, like vnto <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> the firſt borne of <hi>Gedeon,</hi> Iudg. 8.20, 21. for though our Sauiour Chriſt hath conquered theſe our ſpirituall enemies, and hath put the ſword of his ſpirit into our hands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we might alſo vanquiſh them, yet we are afraid to draw the ſword, becauſe we are but freſh water ſouldiers and white liuered; and therefore we had need to encourage our ſelues, not onely by looking on the victorie of our chiefe Captaine, but alſo on the conqueſt of our fellow ſouldiers, who were weake and fraile like our ſelues. So likewiſe Chriſt hath ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world, and willeth vs to be of good comfort, ſeeing we ſhall be partakers with him in his triumph, if we wil ioyne with him in his fight, Ioh. 16.33.<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.33.</note> And though our fleſh be a treacherous enemie and ſtronger to vs then the ſpirit, yet ſo we will fight againſt the luſts thereof we ſhall be ſure of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, for he will aſſiſt vs with his holie ſpirit, and therewith enable vs more and more to mortifie this old man and bodie of ſinne. Well may we take a foyle in this ſpirituall combat, but the Lord wil raiſe vs vp againe; <hi>For though we fall, yet ſhall we not be caſt off, becauſe the Lord putteth vnder his hand,</hi> as it is Pſal. 37.24. And the Lord hath promiſed, that he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>vs to be tempted aboue our power, but will giue the iſſue with the tentation that we may be able to beare it,</hi> as it is 1. Cor. 10.13. and he that hath promiſed is faithfull and true, yea truth it ſelfe, and therefore he will be as good as his word. Though therefore Sathan incounter vs with all furie, let vs not be faint-harted, but couragiouſly endure his aſſaults, and ſo in the end the victorie will be ours: for if wee <hi>reſiſt the diuell he will flie from vs,</hi> Iam. 4.7. if we fight the Lords battailes valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>the God of peace ſhall tread Sathan vnder our feete ſhortly,</hi> as it is Rom. 16.20.

In our preparation we are firſt to conſider of the ſtate, qualitie, and condition of our enemies, and of our meanes how we may withſtand and ouercome them.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, in an enemie who proclaimeth warre againſt vs we are to conſider two things: firſt of his will, and ſecondly of his power. For if he haue will to hurt vs and no power, he is not to be greatly regarded; if power and no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious and vnreconcilable will, he is not ſo much to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but if his power be great and puiſſant, and his will mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, then is it time to looke about vs, and to muſter all our forces, that we may be readie to endure the incounter.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore concerning the will of our grand and arch enemie Sathan, if wee conſider thereof aright, wee ſhall finde
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23802:19"/>that it is moſt malitiouſly bent againſt vs,<note place="margin">Sathans will moſt malicious.</note> ſo that there is no hope of truce or reconciliation with him, though wee could finde in our cowardly hearts to labour and ſue for a diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable peace with Gods and our enemie. For his malice is not newly conceiued but inueterate, euen as ancient within a few daies as the world it ſelfe, and much more durable; for the world ſhall haue an end, but Sathans malice to mankinde is endleſſe, becauſe the cauſe thereof, namely the loue and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God toward the faithfull (whoſe eſtate he doth enuie and maligne, himſelfe being eternally reprobated) ſhall be endleſſe and eternall. And this appeareth in the example of our firſt parents, who were no ſooner placed in the garden of pleaſure, and poſſeſſed of Paradiſe, but Sathan being almoſt burſt with enuie to ſee their happie eſtate, neuer reſted till he had diſgorged his malice, and diſpoſſeſſed them of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe which they enioyed. Neither doth he leſſe maligne and hate thoſe who being fallen in <hi>Adam</hi> are raiſed vp in Chriſt, and haue the fee ſimple of euerlaſting glorie, purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Chriſts merit, aſſured vnto them by the ſpirit of God and a liuely faith. And hence it is that the Lord knowing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans malice towards his children, and that whether he faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth or frowneth, he alwaies ſeeketh their deſtruction, hath proclaimed open warres betweene vs,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> Gen. 3.15. that we may alwaies ſtand vpon our guard, and not be ſurpriſed at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares; that alſo wee may not entertaine a thought of peace, though Sathan offer it on whatſoeuer conditions: for what peace can there be betweene the children of God and the children of Belial, betweene the ſeede of the woman and the ſeede of the ſerpent, ſeeing God himſelfe from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hath put enmitie betweene them?</p>

And this his malice is liuely deciphered vnto vs by diuers names which are giuen him in the Scriptures. For he is called Sathan, that is an aduerſarie, ſtill readie to croſſe vs in all our

               <p>But for as much as the moſt ſauage man hath ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of humanitie left in him, therefore the holie Ghoſt compareth him to beaſts, that wee may expect nothing from him but brutiſh crueltie; as firſt to a lion, yea a lion roring after his pray, who is ſo hungrie and rauenous, that he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing more then to ſeaze vpon that which he purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 1.

               <p>But in truth Sathan is farre more cruell then the roring lion, who (if wee may giue credit to hiſtories) ſpareth thoſe that fall downe flat before him; whereas if he ſhould get vs at ſuch aduantage, he would proudly trample vs vnder foot, and make vs ſure for euer riſing; and therefore leaſt we ſhould looke for any mercie at his hands by ſubmiſſion, the holie Ghoſt calleth him the <hi>great red dragon,</hi>

               <p>But with our enemie it is farre otherwiſe: for as his will is moſt malitiouſly bent to hurt, ſo is he ſtrong and mightie to effect his will.

               <p>If therefore hee durſt encounter the moſt valiant ſouldiers that euer fought the Lords battailes, yea if hee durſt ſet vpon our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe; then ſurely there is no doubt but that he hath courage enough to ſet vpon vs who are weake and feeble, altogether vnable in our ſelues to make reſiſtance.</p>

For as all thoſe which ſecurely contemning them neuer ſtand vpon their guard, are moſt ſure to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed and ouerthrowne; ſo whoſoeuer arme themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and enter into the ſpirituall combat with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ouercome, ſhall moſt certainly obtaine victorie: for though their power be great, yet it is not infinite, and that which they haue, it is not from themſelues but from the Lord, who ſo curbeth them with his all-ruling prouidence, that they are not able to goe one iot further then he looſeth out the raines; as it plainly appeareth both by examples and teſtimonies of Scripture. Though Sathan were moſt mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly diſpoſed againſt <hi>Iob,</hi> ſo that he did with all extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie execute that which God ſuffered him to doe, yet he could not goe one iot further then his commiſſion, he could not touch his ſubſtance till the Lord had ſaid, <hi>All that he hath is in thy hand,</hi> Iob. 1.12. And therefore not preuailing againſt him by depriuing him of his goods and ſubſtance, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth againe to the Lord to haue his commiſſion inlarged, Iob. 2.1. and then hauing gotten authoritie to afflict his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, yet could he not touch his life, becauſe the Lord had not giuen him ſo much liberty. Though <hi>Saul</hi> were a wicked man, yet Sathan could not hurt or vexe him, till the Lord ſent him, 1. Sam. 16.14. And hence it is that he is called the <hi>ſpirit of God,</hi> verſ. 15. and chap. 18.10. becauſe he is Gods ſlaue and wholie at his appointment. So hee could not deceiue the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of <hi>Ahab,</hi> till he had gotten licence of the Lord, 1. King. 22.22. Nay, ſo farre is Sathan from hauing abſolute authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23802:25"/>and power ouer the faithfull, that it is limited and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in reſpect of the meaneſt creatures; for a whole legion of diuels could not ſo much as enter into one heard of ſwine, till by earneſt intreatie they had obtained leaue of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, Luk. 8.31, 32. And therefore much leſſe can they preuaile againſt any of Gods children, ſeeing the very haires of their head are numbred, Matth. 10.29. Well may Sathan maligne vs and earneſtly deſire our deſtruction; well may he ſecke to ſift vs like wheate, as hee did <hi>Peter;</hi> but our Sauiour Chriſt maketh interceſſion for vs, ſo that our faith ſhall neuer faile, Luk. 22.31.</p>
               <p>This alſo is manifeſt by plaine teſtimonies. <hi>Iude</hi> 6. it is ſaid, that the Lord hath <hi>reſerued the wicked angels in euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting chaines vnder darknes, vnto the iudgement of the great day.</hi> 2. Pet. 2.4. <hi>God ſpared not the Angels that had ſinned, but cast them downe into hell, and deliuered them into chaines of darknes to be kept vnto damnation.</hi> So Apoc. 20.2. Sathan is ſaid to haue been bound by the Angell of the Lord for a thouſand yeres, ſo that hee could not ſtirre till the Lord ſuffered him to be looſed. By all which the holie Ghoſt noteth vnto vs, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than is no more able to doe vs hurt, then a malefactor who being bound hand and foote is caſt into a deepe dungeon, or then a band-dog which is faſt tied vp in ſtrong chaines, till the Lord looſeth him and giueth him leaue.</p>
               <p>But here ſome man may obiect, that Sathan is ſaid in the Scriptures, to reſiſt God and to oppoſe himſelfe againſt him, and euen to fight a battaile againſt our Sauiour Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his bleſſed Angels, Apoc. 12.7. I anſwere, that this reſiſtance and fight dependeth on Gods permiſſiue proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, neither could hee ſo much as ſtirre againſt God, if hee did not ſuffer him. He is indeede moſt malitiouſly diſpoſed againſt the Lord, and by this his malice is ſtirred vp to doe thoſe things which hee thinketh moſt diſpleaſant in Gods eyes: but becauſe the Lord chaineth and curbeth him in with his omnipotent power, he is onely able to doe thoſe things that God permitteth him, and, will he nill he, he is conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to obey his Creator and to be at his commandement.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore Sathans power is reſtrained by the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23802:25"/>power of God, this may ſerue as a ſtrong reaſon to ſtrengthen our faith in the aſſurance of victorie; eſpecially conſidering that the Lord is not only omnipotent in power, but alſo in reſpect of his will moſt readie to aide and ſupport vs in all our conflicts. For he hath promiſed vs, that wee ſhall not <hi>be tempted aboue our power,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.13.</note> 
                  <hi>for he will giue a good iſſue to the temptation,</hi> though the beginning and middle are dangerous and troubleſome, 1. Cor. 10.13. He hath promiſed, that if wee will but reſiſt the diuell, wee ſhall put him to flight,<note place="margin">Iam. 4.7.</note> Iam. 4.7. Though therefore in our ſelues wee are very weake, yet God will aſſiſt vs in this combat, which as well concerneth his owne glorie as our good, and being armed with his power, the gates of hell cannot preuaile againſt vs. Well may the Lord ſuffer vs to take a foyle, that thereby learning to know our owne weakenes, wee may the more carefully reſt on his power, and more earneſtly craue his aſſiſtance, but then hee will raiſe vs vp though wee be neuer ſo feeble; for the more apparant our infirmities are, the more cleerely will the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power of the Lord ſhine vnto all the world, when by his helpe we haue obtained victorie.</p>

               <p>But on the other ſide, though wee be neuer ſo wiſe in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wiſedome, and though our heads be a ſtorehouſe of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike ſtratagems, yet if wee neglect Gods word, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily giue our ſelues ouer vnto ſinne and diſobedience, we ſhal be ſo beſotted with follie, that Sathan will eaſily deceiue and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23802:32"/>circumuent vs. An example whereof wee haue in our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who though they were more wiſe by creation than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were any liuing (Chriſt excepted) yet when they caſt the word of God behinde their backe, giuing more credit to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans ſuggeſtions, and withall tranſgreſſed Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; their wiſedome was turned into ignorance and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and they became an eaſie pray to their malitious enemie. And whereas they thought by that meanes to haue gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Lord in policie, and to haue obtained a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure of knowledge and glorie, they were in ſteed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of beſotted with follie, and ouerwhelmed with ignominie and ſhame, by being made the bondſlaues of ſinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than. And thus alſo the heathen neglecting the true worſhip of God, and giuing themſelues to idolatrie, became fooles, whileſt they profeſſed themſelues very wiſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.22.</note> as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, Rom. 1.22. for the <hi>Lord deſtroyeth the wiſedome of the wiſe, and caſteth away the vnderſtanding of the prudent,</hi>

               <p>Seeing then our chiefe wiſedome conſiſteth in the ſtudie of Gods word, and in vprightnes of hart, integritie, Chriſtian ſinceritie and ſimplicitie, and in a holie care of perfourming obedience to Gods will, let vs therefore continually medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in Gods word,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> and with the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> make it our counſellor, Pſal. 119.

Firſt therefore wee muſt containe our ſelues within our generall vocation and ſtation, that is, wee muſt keepe vs in Gods armie and campe, the Church militant: for as thoſe ſtragling ſouldiers who depart from the armie and

And ſecondly, euery one is to containe himſelfe within the limits of his ſpeciall voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to keepe his peculiar ſtanding appointed him by God: for as there is nothing more pernitious to an armie than diſorder, when as ſome intrude themſelues into others place, as when the common ſouldier will be an officer, the Lieutenant Captaine, and the Captaine, Generall of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; ſo nothing is more hurtfull to the Church militant, than when diſorderly one vſurpes another place and office, as when the Miniſters will be Magiſtrates, and the Magiſtrates Miniſters, and when the common people vſurpe the office of them both.</p>

               <p>But let vs come to the armour it ſelfe, which is both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue and offenſiue: the firſt part is the girdle of veritie. The word here vſed ſignifieth a broad ſtudded belt vſed in warres in ancient times, wherewith the ioynts of the breaſt-plate, and that armour which defended the bellie, loynes and thighes were couered. And by this, truth is reſembled: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſome vnderſtand the truth of religion and of the doctrine which we profeſſe, others vnderſtand hereby truth and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes of heart, or the integritie of a good conſcience, whereby wee perfourme all duties of religion belonging to God and our neighbour in ſimplicitie, without all hypocriſie and diſſimulation.

For as the faſter that thoſe trauaile which are out of the way, the further they are from their iourneys end; ſo the more earneſt and forward that wee are in trauailing the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths of error, the further we are from Gods kingdome: and therefore Sathan careth not greatly whether we be of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or of a falſe religion, whether wee worſhip no God at all, or a falſe God, or at leaſt the true God after a falſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whether wee perfourme no dueties vnto God, or ſuch as being not agreeable to Gods truth are abominable vnto him. Firſt then wee muſt containe all our actions within the compaſſe of Gods word, and whatſoeuer wee profeſſe and practiſe, it muſt haue his ground and warrant from this truth, if wee will be accounted true members of Gods militant Church,<note place="margin">1.

True it is that the Saints doe receiue wounds and foyles, when as Sathan hath drawne them to commit ſinne, but they are not wounded at the heart, becauſe they doe not ſinne with full conſent of will; for they allow not that which they doe, neither doe they what they would, but what they hate, and they delight in the law of God concerning the inner man,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.15.22.</note> when the fleſh leadeth them captiue to the law of ſin.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:23802:39"/>weake ſoeuer it be in it ſelfe, yet it doth defend and protect vs againſt all the temptations of Sathan; for he that putteth on faith, doth put on Ieſus Chriſt alſo, it being a propertie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable of faith, to applie vnto vs Chriſt Ieſus and all his benefits, that is, his merits and righteouſnes, and euerlaſting life it ſelfe. And this will be not onely a glorious garment to couer our deformitie out of Gods ſight, to preſerue vs from the heate of Gods wrath, and to obtaine the euerlaſting bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our heauenly father, but alſo it is armour of proofe to defend vs from the violent aſſaults of our ſpirituall enemies.

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.14.</note> as the Apoſtle exhorteth vs, Rom. 13.14. for hauing him wee ſhall want nothing, which may either defend our ſelues or offend our enemies; the Lord himſelfe will be our ſhield and buckler, and therefore it will be impoſſible for our foes to preuaile againſt vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What is meant by quenching Sathans firie darts.</note>But let vs conſider further of the excellencie and neceſſitie of this ſhield of faith, which appeareth by the vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in repelling all the firie darts of Sathan. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that thereby wee may quench his firie darts,</hi> alluding to the cuſtome of ſouldiers in ancient time, who malitiouſly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned their darts, whereby the bodies of thoſe who were wounded were ſo inflamed, that they could hardly be cured, or eaſed of their raging and burning paine. And ſuch darts are all Sathans temptations, whereby wee are wounded with ſinne; for if they bee not repelled and quenched with the ſhield of faith, they will inflame our luſts to ſinne, and one ſinne will inflame our hearts to another, till there be kindled in vs a world of wickedneſſe. And this wee may ſee in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who after that he gaue himſelfe to idleneſſe and ſloth, and ſo was pearced with one of Sathans firie darts, it preſently inflamed his heart to commit adulterie, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen place to that, hee was prouoked to murther; ſo that if wee admit one of theſe firie darts, they will inflame vs to receiue another, and ſo our burning wounds will torment our conſciences, and moſt hardly admit of any cure.</p>
               <p>And therefore it behooueth vs to take vnto vs the ſhield of faith, whereby we may quench theſe firie darts. But why
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23802:39"/>doth the Apoſtle vſe this improper ſpeech, ſeeing the ſhield doth not quench, but repell the darts that beate vpon it? I anſwere, partly to ſhew the nature of our enemies tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, namely, that they are firie, mortall, raging, and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious (as before I ſaid) and partly to ſet foorth a double ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of faith; for firſt thereby wee repell and beate backe his temptations, and ſo <hi>reſiſt him ſtedfastly in the faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.9.</note> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh, 1. Pet. 5.9. And ſecondly, if Sathans darts haue pearced and wounded vs, faith alſo doth coole the ſcorching heate of ſinne, by applying vnto vs the precious baulme of Chriſts blood, ſo that our wounds are not mortall vnto vs, though mortall in themſelues, if they were not cured by this ſoueraigne ſalue of ſinne, which being applied by faith, doth eaſe the burning torments of our euill conſciences, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth vs from all danger of death. The firſt of theſe vertues is ſignified hereby, in that he calleth faith a ſhield, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth Sathans temptations, as the ſhield doth the darts that are caſt againſt it: the ſecond by the word (quenching) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that as water quencheth the fire, ſo faith quencheth the firie darts of Sathans temptations, as is aforeſaid.</p>

If he ſeeke to deceiue vs with his lies, and to ſeduce vs into errors; the word of God is the touchſtone of truth, by which wee diſcerne the pure golden veritie from the droſſie conceits of humane inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the ſubtill deluſions of Sathans probable falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, from the vndoubted certaintie of Gods infallible truth. If he tranſforme himſelfe into an angell of light, Gods word doth pull off his vizard, and maketh him appeare in his owne likenes: if he come vpon vs like a roring lion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure vs, it protecteth vs from danger, and maketh vs ſtrong enough to withſtand his violence. Seeing therefore this wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon is ſo excellent, let vs moſt highly eſteeme it, and manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſe it whenſoeuer Sathan doth aſſault vs and tempt vs vnto ſinne.<note place="margin">How we are to vſe the ſword of the ſpirit in the conflict of temptations.</note> For example, when he inticing vs to commit ſinne, doth extenuate and mince it as though it were but a May-game and a tricke of youth which God regardeth not; let vs draw out the ſword of the ſpirit, ſaying, it is written, that all they are accurſed who continue not in all that is written in the booke of the law to doe it,<note place="margin">Galat. 3 10.

And therefore it behooueth vs to come into Gods ſchoole continually, that there we may learne how to vſe and handle this ſword of Gods word ſo cunningly, that wee may reſiſt Sathan in all his aſſaults, and giue him no aduantage in the fight. Otherwiſe he will vſe it to our own ouerthrow; for if hee durſt fight againſt our Sauiour Chriſt with his owne weapon the word of God, whoſe knowledge was exquiſite and without meaſure, ſaying, It is written; how much more buſie will he be in vſing it againſt vs, who haue not attained vnto the leaſt part of his skill?</p>

                  </note> which alſo our Sauiour Chriſt enioyneth vs, Luk. 18.1. And <hi>Paul</hi> alſo 1. Theſſ. 5.17. not that wee muſt neglect all other exerciſes and doe nothing but pray; for there is a time to heare the word, to do the workes of mercie and of our callings; but his meaning is that we be alwaies readie to pray vpon all good occaſions: eſpecially in the time of temptation this dutie is required, according to that Pſal. 50.15.<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.15.</note> And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith not, that wee muſt pray <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in euery particular time and ſeaſon, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in euery fit time when iuſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and opportunitie is offered. Seeing therefore in the time of temptation we doe eſpecially need the Lords helpe; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that aboue al other is the opportune and conuenient time wherein we are to implore the Lords aſſiſtance. Where by the way the ſtinted prayers of the popiſh rabble, which they reſtraine to ſet houres is confuted, for the Apoſtle wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs alwaies to be in readines when any fit occaſion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing required, is, that wee pray with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of prayers and ſupplication. The former word here vſed is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifieth the earneſt deſiring of any good thing: the other is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is the deprecation of ſome euill; ſo that whether wee want any thing that is good, or would be deliuered from any thing which is euill, wee muſt haue recourſe vnto God by prayer, that we may obtaine the one and auoide the other; but more eſpecially when we feele the want or weaknes of any part of the ſpirituall armour, the graces of Gods ſpirit, wee are to begge them at Gods hand, that ſo wee may be enabled to ſtand in the encounter; and when wee apprehend the extreame malice, ioyned with the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:23802:44"/>great power and cunning policie of our ſpirituall enemies, wee are earneſtly to pray that the Lord will not leade vs into temptation; or if he doe, yet that he will not ſuffer vs to fall therein and to be ouerthrowne. And theſe our prayers muſt not onely be publike in the Church, but alſo priuate in our chambers; neither muſt wee be alwaies begging theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits at Gods hand, but hauing obtained them, we muſt be as readie to giue him thankes, and to aſcribe the glorie of all vnto him, who is the author and beſtower of all vertue and grace which is in vs; and ſo calling vpon God with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of prayer, he will be continually readie to aſſiſt vs in our ſpirituall combat.</p>
               <p>The third thing required, is, that we pray in or by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for the word here vſed may ſignifie both. Firſt therefore we muſt pray in the ſpirit; to which is required firſt that we pray with vnderſtanding; in which reſpect the ignorant Papiſts offend, who pray in an vnknowne tongue; and the ignorant Proteſtants alſo, who though they pray in their owne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, yet know not the ſenſe and meaning of that they ſpeake.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that we pray with attentiue mindes, ioyning our hearts with our tongues, and thoughts with words, to which is oppoſed the prayer of the lippes alone, when as wee draw neere vnto God with our mouthes, our hearts in the meane time being farre from him,<note place="margin">Eſa. 29.13.</note> as it is Eſa. 29.13. Which kinde of prayer is odious and abominable vnto God: for what more groſſe diſcord than when the tongue and heart diſagree from one another, which ſhould be tuned in vniſone? And as the carcaſſe being ſeuered from the ſoule is preſently corrupt and ſtinketh; ſo the prayer of the lips being ſeuered from the prayer of the heart, which is the life and ſoule of it, is but a dead carcaſſe of prayer, and ſtinketh in Gods noſtrels.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that we pray with a pure conſcience and faith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained, <hi>lifting vp pure hands to God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.8.</note> 
                  <hi>without wrath or doubting,</hi> as it is 1. Tim. 2.8. to which is oppoſed prayer proceeding from a polluted conſcience, when as men liue in their ſinnes without any true ſorrow for thoſe which are paſt, or any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere purpoſe to forſake them in the time to come; which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:23802:44"/>prayers muſt needes proceede from an heart full of incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, ſeeing they haue no promiſe in the word whereupon they may ground their faith: nay, contrariwiſe it is ſaid, that <hi>God heareth not ſinners,</hi> Ioh. 9.31. that is,<note place="margin">Ioh. 9.31.</note> ſuch as go on in their ſinnes without repentance, hauing no purpoſe of heart to leaue and forſake them.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee what it is to pray in the ſpirit, which wee cannot perfourme, vnleſſe we pray through and by the ſpirit of God, which helpeth our infirmities, and teacheth vs to pray as wee ought, yea it ſelfe maketh requeſt for vs with ſighes which cannot be expreſſed,<note place="margin">Rom. 8 26. §. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>Of watchfulnes</hi> Matth. 26.</note> as it is Rom. 8.26.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing required is watchfulnes; which dutie is required ioyntly with prayer in many places. Our Sauiour three times ioyneth them together, ſaying, <hi>Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation,</hi> Matth. 26. And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> 1. Epiſt 4.7. ſaith, <hi>Now the end of all things is at hand:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Be ye therefore ſober and watching vnto prayer.</hi> As though hee ſhould ſay, your enemie the diuell as a roring lion walketh about, ſeeking whom he may deuoure, and therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth you at all times like valiant and carefull ſouldiers, who are ſtill in daunger to be aſſaulted by their enemies, to be ſober and watch,<note place="margin">1. Pet 5.8.</note> as it is 1. Pet. 5.8. but now more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeing the end of all things is at hand, for Sathan knowing that his time is but ſhort, will redouble all his forces to work our deſtruction, euen as ſouldiers will moſt fiercely aſſault a town, when as they cannot long lie at the ſiege, either by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of winter drawing on, or the approching of new forces to relieue the towne or raiſe the ſiege. Seeing therefore Sathan redoubleth his force and care in working our deſtruction, let vs redouble our care and watchfulnes in ſeeking to preuent his force and malice. For if Sathan watch continually that he may murther vs, ſhall not wee be watchfull in withſtanding his aſſaults? He is continually in armes to ouerthrow vs, and ſhall not wee watch night and day in our Chriſtian armour, that we may defeate his forces and obtaine victorie?</p>
               <p>Now this our watchfulnes is partly of the bodie, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ſoule. The bodily watching is the abſtaining from naturall ſleepe, to the end that wee may giue our ſelues vnto

And to this watchfulnes the Apoſtle exhorteth vs Eph. 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt,</hi>

                  <hi>let vs therefore caſt away the workes of darknes, and let vs put on the armour of light: So that we walke honeſtly as in the day: not in gluttony and drunkennes, neither in chambering and wantonneſſe, nor in ſtrife and enuying: but putting on the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, taking no thought for the fleſh, to fulfill the lusts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> as it is Rom. 13.12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>And this is the Chriſtian watch which we are to ioyne with prayer: but as I would not haue vs put our whole confidence in the ſpirituall armour, ſo much leſſe in our owne care and watchfulnes; for wee muſt relie our ſelues vpon God onely, deſiring him to watch ouer vs while we ſleepe; but yet with the Lords aſſiſtance wee muſt ioyne our endeuour, and not drowſily and ſleepely receiue his aide: and as the godly huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman expecteth the fruites of the earth from the bleſſing of God, and yet notwithſtanding vſeth all paines, care and diligence in plowing, harrowing and ſowing his ground; ſo we are to ſeeke deliuerance from the force and malice of our ſpirituall enemies of God alone, but yet wee are to ioyne our good endeuour carefully and diligently, vſing all the good meanes which are ordained of God for this purpoſe.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd ſo much concerning our ſpirituall armour, as alſo our preparation to the ſpirituall warfare; now we are to ſpeake of the battaile it ſelfe: where firſt we are to conſider of Sathans ſtratagems, and the manner of his fight; and ſecondly, of the ſpeciall conflicts or temptations wherewith he aſſaileth vs. Concerning Sathans ſtratagems, wee are to know that they are many and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; with which he will eaſily circumuent and ouerthrow vs, if wee doe not carefully preuent or cunningly auoide them. For firſt he dealeth not with all alike, neither vſeth the ſame weapons to foyle euery one,<note place="margin">Sathan wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon our owne corrupt affections.</note> but he obſerueth the qualitie and diſpoſition of his enemies, and accordingly he fitteth his temptations, ſo as they may be moſt forcible to preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. And to this end he obſerueth to what ſinnes wee
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23802:47"/>are moſt inclined, either by nature, or by preſent occaſion, and to thoſe he inciteth vs, thruſting vs as it were downe the hill, where we are apt to runne headlong of our owne accord; and ſeconding his aſſault with the aide of our corrupt fleſh, which intertaineth willingly his ſuggeſtions, and vrgeth vs violently to yeeld to his temptations. So that Sathan neuer ſtriueth againſt the ſtreame, but vſeth the tide of our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to carrie vs ſwiftly into a ſea of ſinne.</p>
               <p>For example, if he finde a man ambitiouſly affected, then he couereth his hooke with the baite of honours: and thus he tempted <hi>Abimelech</hi> to murther all his worthie brethren,<note place="margin">Iudg. 9.</note> that hee might obtaine the ſoueraigntie: thus hee tempted <hi>Ioab</hi> to ſtab traiterouſly <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa,</hi> that hee might ſtill be Captaine Generall: thus he tempted <hi>Abſalon</hi> to vſurp the kingdome,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 14.</note> though it were by the vtter deſtruction of his owne father. And thus he tempted our Sauiour Chriſt to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, by offering him all the kingdomes of the world, thinking belike that he was inclined to ambition, ſeeing hee profeſſed himſelfe a great King, and had no worldly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in his poſſeſſion. So in our daies he tempteth the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious ſubiect to aſpire, without iuſt title, to the Crowne of their lawfull Princes; and thoſe who are Kings alreadie to affect a Monarchie, by vſurping wrongfully their neighbour kingdomes: ſo hee tempteth the Spiritualtie to come by Church-preferments, rather commended by the gifts of the purſe than of the minde; and the Laytie to buy great offices at ſo high a rate that they cannot liue of them, vnleſſe they ſell iuſtice by taking bribes to betray the innocent, and their honeſtie alſo by vſing all extorſion.</p>
               <p>If he find that men are addicted to voluptuouſnes, then he tempteth them to ſinne by offering carnall pleaſures; and thus hee tempted <hi>Noah</hi> to drunkennes, <hi>Dauid</hi> to adulterie, <hi>Salomon</hi> to idolatrie and all wickedneſſe. And thus now hee tempteth ſome to good fellowſhip, that is, to ſpend their whole time in drunkennes, belly-cheare, and all riotous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and Epicuriſme; ſome to luſt, incontinencie, and all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous pleaſures of the fleſh. Or if he cannot bring them to ſuch carnall groſſnes, hee will intice them to vſe lawfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:23802:48"/>vnlawfully, and immoderatly ſpending all their time in pleaſure, which they ſhould beſtow in the ſeruice of God, by imploying themſelues in the generall duties of Chriſtianitie, and in the ſpeciall duties of their callings.</p>

With this baite he inticed <hi>Iudas</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his maſter, ſelling him for thirtie peeces of ſiluer, whoſe worth could not be valued with many worlds.

               <p>Neither doth hee angle with this baite in the Court and countrie onely, but he thinketh it fit for the citie alſo: for he commeth to the couetous Merchant, and promiſeth him that in ſuch a countrie he ſhall haue good trafficke, if hee will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his religion, that is, denie Chriſt before men: he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to the ſhop-keeper increaſe of wealth, if hee will vſe falſe waights &amp; meaſures, and falſe lights, or els ſell ſuch wares as are neither profitable for the Church nor Common-wealth; or adulterate and falſifie his ſtuffe by mixing bad with good; or aske double the price, ſwearing that it coſt him more than afterwards himſelfe is contented to take: in a word, if in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſelling he will vſe fraud, lying, ſwearing and forſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, hee promiſeth to make him a rich man, though often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiueth him, for in ſtead of increaſing in wealth by theſe vngodly practiſes, oftentimes he becomes banke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, the Lord laying his curſe on thoſe wicked meanes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe bleſſing the builder buildeth and the labourer la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth but in vaine, as it is Pſal. 127. 1.2.<note place="margin">Pſal. 127.1.2.</note> So alſo he commeth to the Artificer, and telleth him that if he will be rich, he muſt make ſale ware: and what is that? ſuch as is ſleight and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnfit for vſe; as though that were moſt fit for ſale which is ſleight and altogether vnprofitable.

               <p>So alſo Sathan taketh aduantage of our complexion and temperature; by tempting the Sanguine to pleaſure and luſt; the Flegmaticke to idlenes and ſloth; the Melancholicke to enuie and malice; the Cholericke man he prouoketh to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and braules, and inticeth him to take reuenge by aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating the iniurie, and ſuggeſting that it will be great diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to put vp ſuch a wrong.

For as when a citie is beſieged, the inhabitants will moſt ſtrongly man that place, which by nature is moſt weake and aſſaultable, becauſe they know that the enemie will giue the onſet there where he is like to finde the eaſieſt entrance: ſo wee being beſieged with our ſpirituall enemies, are moſt carefully to obſerue where our ſoules are weakeſt to make reſiſtance, and ouer that part wee are to watch with greateſt diligence, aſſuring our ſelues that there Sathan will plant all his engines of batterie, that hauing made a breach hee may enter and ſurprize vs.<note place="margin">Ierem. 17.9.</note> And becauſe the heart of man is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aboue all things, and none but God know it, let vs ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon it often before the throne of Gods iudgement, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it by his law, that thereby wee may ſee our ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and after labour to kill and mortifie them.</p>
               <p>If we finde that wee be ambitiouſly affected, wee are to vſe all good meanes that true humilitie may bee wrought in our hearts, and whenſoeuer (honours being offred) we are tickled with ambitious and aſpiring thoughts, let vs ſuſpect that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der honour Sathan hath hid a hooke to catch vs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before wee accept it, wee are to examine our ſelues whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be fit for ſo high a place, and whether we can attaine thereto by honeſt and lawfull meanes, and whether the place it ſelfe be ſuch, that therein we may glorifie God, benefit his Church, and keepe a good conſcience.</p>
               <p>So if we finde that we are addicted vnto pleaſures, wee are with all care to ſtudie and practiſe true mortification; and when any pleaſures are offred vs, wee are to looke narrowly into them, that we may diſcerne if Sathan hath not laid vnder them a ſnare to intrap vs, either by tempting vs to pleaſures which are vnlawfull, or to the immoderate vſe of thoſe which be lawfull; and as we loue the ſaluation of our ſoules, let vs auoide the baite when we ſee the ſnare.</p>
               <p>In like manner if wee finde that we are prone to couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, let vs carefully labour to weane our ſelues from this vice,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:23802:50"/>by conſidering that it is idolatrie,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.9.10. Eph. 5.5. Col. 3.5.

And when any commoditie is offred vs, we are to looke twice on it before we accept thereof, examining whether wee may compaſſe it by honeſt and good meanes, and without the hurt of our brethren, and then wee may take it as ſent from God; otherwiſe we may aſſure our ſelues, that how pleaſantly ſoeuer the baite looketh, yet Sathan hath hid vnder it a deadly hooke, and therfore if we ſwallow the baite the hooke will choake vs.</p>
               <p>And thus alſo are we to behaue our ſelues in reſpect of all other ſinnes, to which we finde after due examination we are addicted, if wee will be ſafe from the diuels malice and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning furie, knowing that where we are moſt weake, there he will giue the moſt violent aſſaults.</p>

Sect. </seg>4</label> But beloued,<note place="margin">How we may reſiſt the former temptations.</note> if we would not be ſubdued by Sathan, let vs be moſt carefull in withſtanding this dangerous aſſault: for there is not any one temptation wherewith Sathan preuaileth more, than by perſwading men to content themſelues with a ciuill kinde of honeſtie, which is deſtitute of religion and the true feare of God. And to this end let vs conſider, that ciuill honeſtie ſeuered from true pietie is but glorious iniquitie: for when wee haue attained to as great a meaſure thereof, as poſſibly we can in this age of corruption, we ſhall come ſhort in diuers duties of many of the Heathens, who haue excelled in theſe morall and ciuill vertues: and conſequently when we are at the beſt we ſhall be but honeſt Infidels and good natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red worldlings, if wee doe not ioyne thereunto the duties of pietie. And how goodly a ſhew ſoeuer our workes make in the eyes of men, yet are they odious in Gods ſight, if they be not done in knowledge, and grounded on Gods word and commandement, but in ignorance and according to our own inuentions and the fond conceit of our blind vnderſtanding; if they proceede not from the true loue of God, which is the onely fountaine of all acceptable obedience, but from the loue of our ſelues and other carnall reſpects; if they bee not the fruites of a liuely faith, but done in ignorance and infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; for, <hi>what ſoeuer is not done in faith, is ſinne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.23. Heb. 11.6.</note> as it is Rom. 14.23. and therefore cannot pleaſe God, Heb. 11.6. By which we are not to vnderſtand an hiſtoricall faith, whereby wee know and are aſſured that thoſe workes wee doe are commanded in Gods word; but a true iuſtifying faith which doth applie vnto vs Chriſt Ieſus, and all Gods mercifull promiſes made in him. For, that our workes may be acceptable before God, there is required firſt that our perſons bee acceptable vnto him, neither can any thing we doe pleaſe him, ſo long as we remaine his enemies, in which ſtate we are by nature, till wee are reconciled in Chriſt our Mediatour, as appeareth Rom. 5.10.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.10.

               <p>Secondly, the beſt of our workes are imperfect, and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:23802:52"/>with many corruptions, and therefore cannot abide the examination of Gods exact iuſtice, till their imperfections be couered by Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and their corruption waſhed away with his moſt precious bloud; now Chriſt and his merits cannot by any other meanes be applied vnto vs, but by the hand of a liuely faith.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if all our works and honeſt dealing be not done in zeale of Gods glorie, &amp; referred to this end that Gods name may be magnified, they are not acceptable before God: for, the cauſe why he would haue our light ſhine before men, is, that he our heauenly father may be glorified,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.16.</note> as it is Matth 5. 16. and the maine and wherefore wee ſhould haue our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation honeſt amongſt the Gentiles and vnbeleeuers, is, that they which ſpeake euill of vs, as of euill doers, may, by our good works which they ſhall ſee, glorifie God in the day of their viſitation,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>And therefore let not Sathan deceiue vs, in perſwading vs to reſt in ciuill honeſtie; for if it be ſeuered from true pietie, from ſauing knowledge, from ſincere loue of God, iuſtifying faith, and a zeale of Gods glorie, it will not be acceptable in Gods ſight; as proceeding from the loue of our ſelues, and other carnall reſpects, namely to obtaine praiſe or profit thereby.</p>

If he cannot ſo preuaile, by reaſon that the bright beames of the Goſpell ſhining in the preaching of the word doe diſcouer his errours and lies, giuing light to thoſe that ſit in the darknes of ignorance, and in the ſhadow of death, whereby their feete are guided into the way of peace, then he laboureth to ouerwhelme them with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of their ſinnes, and to plunge them into the bottomleſſe gulfe of horrour and deſpaire, by aggrauating the odiouſnes of their rebellion, and huge multitudes of their outragious tranſgreſſions, by ſetting before them the curſe of the law, the vengeance of God due vnto them, his infinite and exact iuſtice which muſt be ſatisfied, and the vnſpeakable and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe torments prepared for the damned.

He will tempt them to propound this end of their good workes, that they may be ſaued by them, becauſe God hath promiſed to reward them; or to neglect good workes, as vnneceſſarie to ſaluation, becauſe faith alone iuſtifieth. Which temptations if wee would withſtand, wee muſt labour after true ſauing knowledge that we may diſcerne betweene vertue and vice, truth and error, that which God hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as vnlawfull, from that which hee hath commanded as lawfull; to this end vſing diligently all good meanes which tend to this purpoſe, as hearing, reading, meditating, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of Gods word, that ſo the clowdes of ignorance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpelled with the light of knowledge, wee may diſcouer Sathans deluſions and deceits.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus haue I ſhewed at large Sathans firſt pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke ſtratagem, which he vſeth to circumuent vs by fitting his temptations according to our nature and diſpoſition, or our ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A ſecond pollicie which Sathan vſeth to circumuent vs, is this; if he cannot at the firſt intice vs to fall into outragious wickednes,<note place="margin">Sathan labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to draw vs into outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſinnes by degrees.</note> he will ſeeke to draw vs thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by degrees, beginning at the leaſt, and ſo bringing vs from that to a greater, till at laſt we come to the higheſt ſtep of wickednes: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that as thoſe who walke to the top of an high hill, whoſe aſcent ariſeth by little and little, come to the top without wearines, before they well perceiued that they did aſcend; ſo they who goe forward in the waies of wickednes by degrees, do without any controul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or checke of conſcience clime vp to the higheſt top thereof, whence Sathan caſteth them down headlong into the pit of deſtruction. For example, if he ſee a profeſſor of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which maketh conſcience of his waies, he doth not vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeke at firſt to draw him into heinous ſinnes, vnleſſe the cordes of his temptations be exceeding ſtrong; but firſt he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lureth him to come into the companie of wicked men, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſome pleaſure or profit, or by occaſion of affinitie and marriage, ioyning him if he can with ſuch a yokefellow as wil draw him faſter backe than he can draw her forward in the courſe of godlines. If he thus farre preuaile, then he tempteth him to winke at their ſins which in conſcience he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that he may ſtill inioy his pleaſure and profit, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their loue and fauour; then in the next place he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him to thinke them tollerable ſinnes which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and nothing ſo outragious as others fall into; and when he hath made this progreſſe, then he inticeth him to taſte of ſinne, which he ſo ſweetneth with the ſugred delights of this
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:23802:55"/>vaine world that he ſwalloweth it downe without all loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe, and neuer taſteth the bitterneſſe thereof till the heat of Gods ſpirit doe cauſe it worke in his conſcience, ſo as he is neuer at reſt till he haue caſt it vp againe by vnfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Otherwiſe if he be not preuented thus by Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Sathan will by this meanes cauſe his conſcience to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and to digeſt ſuch loathſome ſinnes, which in former times he abhorred to ſee others commit. And as thoſe who from their infancie are accuſtomed to take poyſons in ſmall quantities doe enable their ſtomackes to digeſt more, till by long cuſtome and increaſing the quantitie by degrees, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth ſo familiar to their ſtomackes, that inſtead of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning them they are nouriſhed thereby, as hiſtories doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of ſome of the Indian Kings: ſo Sathan inticeth vs to ſwallow downe the poyſon of ſinne at the firſt in ſuch ſmall quantitie, that our conſciences may not be ſicke thereof: but hauing well digeſted the leaſt, he increaſeth the meaſure till by long cuſtome he hath made it ſo familiar to our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that thoſe ſinnes are euen meate and drinke vnto vs, which at the firſt we loathed as deadly poyſons.</p>
               <p>Now if we would defeate this pollicie of Sathan, we muſt continually watch ouer our owne hearts and pull them backe when wee ſee that they but incline vnto any ſinne; we muſt not lightly eſteeme of any ſinne, nor willingly giue entertainment to the leaſt wicked thought, for though in it ſelfe it be not ſo hainous, yet it will inlarge our conſciences and make roome for a greater, til at laſt we keepe open houſe, readie to receiue all wickednes which offereth it ſelfe vnto vs; and as we are carefull to auoyde the ſinnes themſelues, ſo with as much diligence we are to ſhunne the occaſions and meanes by which we might be drawne, or inticed thereunto. But of this point more hereafter.</p>

For example, when we ſee the vileneſſe of prodigalitie, ſo as we will no longer be poſſeſſed of that vice, then will Sathan make it as odious as he can, and indeauour to bring vs into extreame hatred thereof, that ſo he may the more eaſily draw vs into the contrarie vice
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:23802:55"/>of couetouſneſſe. If he cannot any longer keepe vs aſleepe in ſinne, by rocking vs in the cradell of carnall ſecuritie, and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto vs the ſweete tunes of Gods mercie and Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will he labour to plunge vs in deſpaire, by ſetting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes the heynouſneſſe of our ſinnes, and ſounding in our eares the thundring threatnings of the law. If he cannot any longer nuzzle vs in ſuperſtition, and cauſe vs to place all our religion in ceremonies, and in reſtrayning our ſelues of the vſe of things indifferent, he will draw vs to the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame by mouing vs to thinke all ceremonies vnlawfull, and to practiſe all licenciouſnes vnder pretence of chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. If he can no longer perſwade vs to ſeeke for iuſtification by the workes of the law to the end wee may not rely on Chriſts merits and righteouſnes, he will bring vs into vtter diſlike of this doctrine, by ſhewing vs the abſurdities thereof, that he may draw vs to the other extreme, namely to neglect good workes, as altogether vnneceſſarie to ſaluation becauſe faith alone iuſtifieth. If he cannot hide out of our ſight the ſhining graces of Gods ſpirit by caſting before our eyes the cloude of our ſinnes and corruptions, then he will cauſe vs to looke on them through the ſpectacles of ſelfe loue and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the end we may imagine them much greater than in truth they are, and ſo be puffed vp in pride, and too ſecurely reſt in thoſe gifts we haue, not ſeeking for increaſe. If he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſwade vs to diffidence and diſtruſt, he will moue vs to tempt God vpon no neceſſarie occaſions: and thus he dealt with our Sauiour Chriſt, for firſt he tempted him to diſtruſt Gods prouidence, and to prouide for himſelfe by turning ſtones into bread; but when he could not ſo preuaile, he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to make an vnneceſſarie experiment of his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and care, by caſting himſelfe downe headlong from the pinacle of the temple, whereas there were ordinarie meanes whereby he might deſcend.</p>
               <p>Now the end why Sathan vſeth this pollicie is, more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to caſt vs into one extreame of ſinne, when with full ſwinge of will we do auoyde the other: as alſo to make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that the latter temptation is the motion of Gods ſpirit, ſeeing it is cleane contrarie to the former ſuggeſtion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,

For example, he will tempt vs to the contempt of Gods word; if he cannot ſo preuaile, he will intice vs at leaſt to neglect it; and if thus he cannot hurt vs, he will, if he can, choake the ſeede of Gods word with the thornie cares of the world, and ſo make it vnfruitfull. He will moue vs to thinke that Chriſt was no Sauiour; if he cannot perſwade vs to this, then he will tell vs he is not our Sauiour. Yea ſo ſhameleſſe is this tempter, that he will now tempt vs to beleeue one lie of his coyning, and preſently after when hee ſeeth wee giue no credit to that, he wil tell vs the cleane contrarie. For example, he will ſometimes tell vs that wee are ſuch grieuous ſinners that there is no way but damnation: and if we withſtand this aſſault, hee will ſoone after perſwade vs to an ouerweening conceit of our owne excellencie, and to a phariſaicall opinion that wee are not as other men are. Sometimes he will moue vs to doubt of our election, and if he cannot thus preuaile, he will preſently perſwade vs to thinke our election ſo ſure, that though wee follow our owne luſts, and giue our ſelues ouer to all outragious wickedneſſe, yet in the end wee ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. In a word, this wicked <hi>Protheus</hi> will transforme himſelfe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23802:59"/>into a thouſand diuers ſhapes, and in a ſhort ſpace will varie many waies his temptations, that if hee cannot preuaile by one meanes, he may ouercome vs by another. And therefore it behooueth vs, if we will withſtand him, to arme our ſelues, not on one ſide alone, nor to bee prepared againſt two or three aſſaults of our ſpirituall enemie, but wee muſt be readie to anſwere all obiections, and not ſo wholie incline to one ſide and to the defending one part, as that in the meane time wee leaue the other naked to bee wounded with Sathans blowes. And to the end we may the rather be encouraged to ſtand conſtantly in our defence, wee are to know that when Sathan doth ſo often ſhift his temptations, and in a ſhort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time doth ſeeke to bring vs into quite contrary vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">The oft chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sathans temptations a probable ſigne that he doth not preuaile.</note> it is a manifeſt ſigne that he doth not yet preuaile: for as no enemie is ſo fooliſh as will after that hee hath made one ſufficient breach for entrie, or forced one gate of the citie, go from that to another, but rather enter where the way is made; ſo Sathan laying ſiege to our ſoules, would not ſeeke to make a new battrie with his temptations, if the former had made way for him to enter and ſurprize vs; he would not tempt vs to pride and preſumption, if he had ouercome our faith and plunged vs into deſpaire; hee would neuer tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe into an angell of light, if he could haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vs in his owne likenes; he would neuer tell vs of Gods mercie, if hee had alreadie ouerwhelmed vs with the ſight of our ſins, and conſideration of Gods iuſtice; nor yet of Gods iuſtice, if he could keepe vs in carnall ſecuritie, by ſetting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs his mercie: but that way whereby he perceiues he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whit preuailes, he will follow and continue earneſt in the ſame purſuite, till he perceiue he cannot catch vs. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the fit of the ague ſhifteth from time to time, it is a good ſigne that our nature waxing ſtrong doth preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the diſeaſe; ſo when Sathans temptations in a ſhort time often change, and that from one contrarie to another, it is a ſigne that Gods ſpirit being ſtrong in vs, doth reſiſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and putteth him to theſe ſhifts, whereas he would hold on a conſtant courſe if he preuailed againſt vs.</p>

And therefore if we would reſiſt this temptation, we muſt labour after true knowledge, that we may not depend vpon others for our direction, but vpon the word of God alone, and not liue by example, but by precept; for the ſtraighteſt rule that euer was of the moſt holy mans life (our Sauiour Chriſt excepted) is often and in many places crooked (for who is it that hath not erred and gone aſtray?) and therefore if we alwaies follow their examples in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, we ſhall erre with them beſides all our owne errors.</p>

For as the ſpirit of God doth ſo moue vs to all vertuous and holy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as that in the meane time we would thinke his motions to be our owne godly cogitations,<note place="margin">2.

By reaſon whereof it commeth to paſſe that Sathan wanteth no opportunitie of circumuenting vs, becauſe we can put no difference betweene his temptations and our owne carnall deſires: and therefore he hauing gotten (as it were) our owne watchword, we are readie to open the gates of our ſoules when he offereth to enter, and to yeeld to his temptations as ſoone as he aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs; where as no man almoſt is ſo outragiouſly deſperat that would wittingly and willingly entertaine Sathans ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, whom he knoweth to be a common enemie to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, continually ſeeking their deſtruction, though hee ſhould intice him hereunto by offering much riches and great preferments. Yea hence it is that after Sathan hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times deceiued and circumuented vs, yet cannot we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of him, nor auoyde his deceits. For whereas if a man doe giue vs euill counſell, or any way couſin vs, yet after once or twice he come vnto vs, we can take heede of him, and though he make faire ſhewes of honeſtie and friendſhip, we will notwithſtanding be very iealous and ſuſpicious leaſt againe hee ouerreach vs; when Sathan commeth to vs this day and tempteth vs to ſuch groſſe wickednes, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but diſcerne them to be his ſuggeſtions, yet this is no impediment to him but that he may come againe to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and deceiue vs with ſome more ſubtill pollicie, becauſe we cannot diſcerne betweene his ſuggeſtions and our owne thoughts, and therefore doe acknowledge no other author of his temptations but our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo it is that he will not ſticke to tempt the moſt godly vnto the groſſeſt impietie, and the moſt learned and ſound in iudgement, to entertaine the abſurdeſt hereſie or error. For if he preuaile (which ſometime he doth as we may ſee in the example of <hi>Dauid</hi> whom he tempted to adulterie and murther, though hee were a man according to Gods owne heart; and of <hi>Peter</hi> whom, hee tempted to deny and forſweare Chriſt, though hee were a moſt worthie Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) then he getteth a great victorie, and giueth them a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:23802:62"/>foyle; but if he be repulſed, yet this is no hinderance vnto him, why he may not entrap them in ſome more ſecret ambuſhment. Hence it is that though he begin his fight with cunning pollicie, taking vpon him the perſon of a friend, and tranſforming himſelfe into an Angell of light, yet this is no impediment but that he may afterwards againe appeare and violently aſſault vs in his owne likenes; as he aſſaulted our Sauiour, firſt with ſubtill and ſecret temptations, like a friend and welwiller; and when he could not ſo preuaile, he doth not ſticke to appeare like himſelfe, tempting him to outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious groſſe idolatrie, ſaying, all this will I giue thee if thou wilt fall downe and worſhip me. And contrariwiſe though he begin his aſſault like a diuell and profeſſed enemie, this is no hinderance but that he may end it like an Angell of light, and a flattering treacherous friend. So when he hath inticed vs to one extreme and preuaileth not, this is no impediment but that ſoone after he may allure vs to the cleane contrarie; becauſe though we thinke the firſt motion to be his ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, yet we may imagine the other to be our owne thought, or (as I ſaid) the motion of Gods ſpirit, becauſe it is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the former.</p>

               <p>Secondly, when as the ſuggeſtion is vrged with great force and violence, and leaueth behind it a deepe impreſſion, which ſeemeth to bring a neceſſitie of doing that which is euen contrarie to naturall reaſon, whereas the ſuggeſtions of the fleſh doe rather leade and intice vs then draw and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force vs vnto ſinne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the temptations of Sathan moue vs oftentimes to ſuch outragious wickednes, and helliſh impietie, that euen nature corrupted doth condemne as abhominable, and euen trembleth with feare and horror, when they are firſt ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, rhe fleſh taketh occaſion of things preſent and ſubiect to the ſenſes to intice vs vnto ſinne; but Sathans ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions ſometimes are farre fetcht and ſo ſtrange vnto vs, that before the inſtant they are ſuggeſted we neuer thought or ſo much as dreamed of them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the things whereunto we are tempted by the fleſh, are alwaies delightfull and pleaſing vnto vs; but ſathan temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs alſo to thoſe things which are irkſome and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous: as namely to ſuperſtitious abſtinence whereby the body is almoſt ſtarued; to puniſhing of our owne bodies, as he tempted the Baalitiſh prieſts, to cut and launce themſelues
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:23802:63"/>before their idol; and the ſuperſttious papiſts to whip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before their images, and to take vpon them tedious and daungerous pilgrimages to idols and reliques of Saints; and the idolatrous heathen to burne in ſacrifice their deare children. So alſo he tempteth ſome to deſpaire of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and ſo torment themſelues with horror and feare; yea ſometimes to lay violent hands vpon themſelues, murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and taking away their owne life, which by nature is ſo deere and precious vnto them. All which being contrarie to our naturall inclinations and the deſires of the fleſh, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appeare to be the ſuggeſtions of Sathan.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the chiefe differences betweene the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Sathan and the fleſh; otherwiſe they are commonly ſo like one to the other that they can hardly be diſcerned: and therefore let vs not be ſo carefull, curiouſly to diſtinguiſh them, as to auoyde or reſiſt them; knowing that Sathan is the captaine generall, and the fleſh and the luſts thereof Sathans chiefe aides and aſſiſtants, which continually fight againſt the ſpirit and labour to plunge both bodie and ſoule into euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction.</p>

Whereas on the other ſide if we ſpend our times in idlenes, and doe not diligently exerciſe our ſelues in the duties of chriſtianitie, and of our ſeuerall callings; then are our mindes fit groundes to receiue the ſeedes of Sathans temptations, and to nouriſh them till they bring forth the fruites of ſinne: and if Sathan finde vs like emptie houſes cleane ſwept and voyde of all holy meditations and godly exerciſes, he will eaſily enter, and if himſelfe be not ſtrong enough he will take vnto him ſeuen other ſpirits worſe than himſelfe,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.45.</note> that ſo he may be more ſtrong to keepe poſſeſſion.

For example, when he ſetteth before our eyes the haynouſneſſe of our ſinnes, we are not to bend all our thoughts to meditate and call to minde all our ſinnes both new and old, both which we haue fallen into through infirmitie, and which we haue willingly committed, for ſo the huge cloude of our ſinnes being neere our eyes, will hide from our ſight the ſhyning beames of Gods mercie and Chriſts merit, though they are without compariſon greater: but as ſoone as we caſt one eye vpon our ſinnes for our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, let vs caſt the other preſently vpon Chriſt Ieſus who hath payed the price of our redemption, and ſuffered all the puniſhment which we by our ſinnes had deſerued. For if when this fierie ſerpent Sathan hath ſtung vs with the ſting of ſinne, we ſpend our time in looking vpon the wound, and neuer thinke vpon the remedie, euen the true braſen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent Ieſus Chriſt hanging on the croſſe: the poyſon of ſinne will ſo inflame our conſciences, that the wound will proue mortall, which at the firſt might eaſily haue been cured if we would haue applied thereunto the precious balme of our Sauiours blood. So when Sathan ſetteth before our eyes our owne wickednes and infirmities, to the end we may deſpaire of victorie, as being neuer able to withſtand ſuch ſtrong temptations, we are not to ſpend our time in thinking here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, but preſently to call to minde the almightie power of God who hath promiſed vs his aſſiſtance in this ſpirituall fight. So when he obiecteth vnto vs the iuſtice and wrath of God, in puniſhning of ſinne, and the curſe of the law and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell prepared for the damned; we are not ouer ſeriouſly to reuolue theſe things in our mindes; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to call to minde Gods infinit mercie and Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whereby Gods iuſtice is fully ſatiſfied, his wrath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the curſe of the law cancelled, and we made of fire brands of hell heires of heauen. And thus if as ſoone as Sathan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:23802:70"/>the wound we apply the cure, it will neuer be mortall vnto vs; but if we let the poyſon of his temptations runne in our mindes and neuer thinke of any remedie, though at the firſt it ſeemed but a ſmall ſcratch, it will ſo inflame our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences with ſcorching heate that they will afterwards very hardly admit of any cure. When therefore Sathan doth caſt into our mindes his temptations, let vs repell them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to quench them whileſt they be but ſmall ſparkes: for our corrupt mindes are like vnto tinder, and Sathans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations like the fire, and therefore if in ſtead of putting them out we blow vpon them, though they be but as a ſmall ſparke at the firſt, within a while they will increaſe to an vnquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able flame which will torment our conſciences with ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heate: neither is there any thing but the blood of Chriſt, and the water of the ſpirit which will extinguiſh this wilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire when once it hath taken deepe hold on vs.</p>

How therefore muſt the chriſtian thus ouertaken behaue himſelfe? ſurely he is not deſperatly to caſt away all hope of victorie and cowardly to yeelde himſelfe to be the ſlaue of Sathan, lying contentedly in the chaines of ſinne, without any deſire or indeauour of comming out of his captiuitie: but being fallen he is to labour and ſtriue that he may riſe againe, and being taken priſoner by ſinne and Sathan, he is not willingly to remaine in their bonds but earneſtly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire his freedome and libertie.</p>

As firſt, that this deſire be ioyned with an holy inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and earneſt ſtriuing and labouring in the vſe of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:23802:71"/>meanes, whereby wee may attaine vnto thoſe graces which we doe deſire: for it is not ſufficient that wee wiſh for faith, repentance, and other graces, vnleſſe we indeuour to attaine vnto them, and to this end carefully vſe all good meanes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God for the obtaining our deſires.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this deſire muſt not be ſuddaine like a flaſh of lightening, vaniſhing away as ſoone as it entreth into vs, but we muſt conſtantly perſeuere in it, till it be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it muſt not bee a ſlight, and indifferent deſire, as though we would haue theſe graces, if we could eaſily attaine vnto them, otherwiſe wee doe not greatly care whether wee haue them or no: but it muſt bee very earneſt, at leaſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, though not alwayes: So as we may ſay with <hi>Dauid: My ſoule longeth after thee, O Lord, as the thirſtie land.</hi> Pſal. 63.1. And, <hi>As the Hart brayeth for the riuers of water, ſo pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth my ſoule after thee, O God:</hi> as it is Pſal. 42.1.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this deſire is true, and pleaſing vnto God, when as it proceedeth from a ſenſe of our owne want and penurie, in regard whereof we are truely humbled. And hereof it is compared to hungering and thirſting; in which two things concurre, firſt, a ſence of want which afficteth vs, and, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to haue it ſupplied.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it is not ſufficient that we haue a continuall and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire of our ſaluation, vnleſſe wee deſire as earneſtly the ſubordinate cauſes and meanes tending thereunto; namely, vocation, iuſtification, ſanctification, faith, repentance, and the reſt of the graces of Gods ſpirit: for euen <hi>Balaam</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did wiſh that he might die the death of the righteous, but his deſire was not acceptable to God, becauſe he wiſhed not alſo to liue their life: he deſired to die like them, that he might be ſaued; but hee deſired not to ſerue the Lord in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and newneſſe of life, whereby he might haue been aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of ſaluation.</p>
               <p>If therefore wee would haue our deſires acceptable to God, they muſt be ioyned with an holy indeuour to obtaine thoſe ſpirituall graces which we doe deſire, they muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, earneſt, and proceede from a true ſence and feeling of our owne want, and be referred as well to the meanes, as to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:23802:72"/>the ende, and then the deſire of grace is the grace it ſelfe; the deſire of faith is faith; the deſire of repentance is repentance; not in it owne nature, but in Gods acceptation, who accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the will for the deede.</p>

Seeing then our ſinnes and falles do ſhew vnto vs our owne infirmities &amp; weakenes, and theſe doe declare Gods vnreſiſtable power and might, which notwithſtanding our feebleneſſe doth vphold vs: therefore let vs ſo deſpaire in our ſelues, as that thereby we may be mooued to rely wholy vpon the Lord, hauing ſo much more hope of victorie, as the ſtrength of God excelleth the ſtrength of man; let vs be ſo humbled with a true ſenſe, and ſorrow for our owne infirmities and corruption, as that in the meane time we may receiue more ſound conſolation and true ioy, becauſe we ſtand not by our owne ſtrength, which euery hower would faile vs, but by the power of Gods might: and therefore though Sathan and all the power of hell conſpire and bande themſelues againſt vs, yet ſhall they not preuaile; and though they foyle vs, yet ſhall they neuer finally ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; for he that is with vs is ſtronger than all they who are

For he that altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relieth vpon the Lords aſſiſtance, and wholy diſtruſteth his owne ſtrength, when he falleth in the time of temptation, is not much aſtoniſhed with any great wonder, knowing that through his owne infirmitie and weakenes, he is moſt apt to fall when God leaueth him to himſelfe; neither is he vtterly diſcouraged and ouerwhelmed with deſpaire, as though now there were no meanes to ſtand in the ſpirituall combate, and to obtaine victorie; but hating and with a peaceable and quiet ſorrow mourning for his ſinne, becauſe thereby he hath diſhonored his God, and offended his diuine maieſtie, he doth not abate his hope; but with leſſe confidence in himſelfe and more confidence in God, he renewes the fight againſt his ſpirituall enemies, with vndanted courage; knowing that the Lord in whom he truſteth and wholy relieth will neuer faile him.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:23802:80"/>our minds againſt euery one of them. The firſt and principall cauſe of our ſaluation is Gods eternall loue and immutable goodwill, wherewith he hath loued his creatures from before the foundations of the world were laid; the which loue and goodwill in himſelfe did moue him to elect them to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom he ſo loued without any deſerts in themſelues: for how could they deſerue any thing at Gods hath before they were? or what good could the Lord foreſee in them, but that which in his eternall counſaile hee purpoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow and impart vnto them?</p>

For if Sathan ſee men liuing in carnall ſecuritie, frozen in the dregges of their ſinnes, ſo as in truth there is no ſigne that they are beloued of God; he will perſwade them that they are highly in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and loue, and therefore though they runne on in their wicked courſes, yet they ſhall be ſaued. Doeſt thou not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue (will he ſay) that God dearely loueth thee? Why, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that hee hath made thee one of his chiefeſt creatures, whereas otherwiſe hee would haue made thee a toade or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; he hath alſo like a tender father preſerued and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thee from thy infancie, and which is more, he hath ſent his dearely beloued ſonne to die for thee, and hee hath made choiſe of thee amongſt many others to be a member of his Church, where thou inioyeſt the preaching of the Goſpell, and the vſe of the Sacraments, to the end thou maiſt be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of thy ſaluation without all queſtion or doubting. Neuer therefore take care nor trouble thy ſelfe concerning thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, vſe not ſuch ſtrictnes and preciſenes of life, but take thy pleaſure, and follow thoſe delights which the Lord hath beſtowed vpon thee as pledges of his loue; for thou art not now a ſlaue but a ſonne, and therefore maiſt more freely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thine owne deſire, and vſe thy libertie: caſt away all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile feare, which maketh thee take ſuch paines in vſing all meanes whereby thou maiſt be aſſured of ſaluation; for thou art aſſured of the principall, namely of Gods loue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:23802:81"/>thou needeſt not to doubt of the reſt, nor to debarre thy ſelfe of thy pleaſures, ſpending thy time in feare and care, to the end thou maiſt get the aſſurance of that which thou nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not to call into queſtion.</p>

Why, doe but take a view of thy ſelfe, and thou ſhalt ſee that originall corruption hath ouerſpread both thy bodie and ſoule like a filthy leproſie; vnto which thou haſt added actuall tranſgreſſions more in number than the haires of thy head, or the ſtarres of heauen; for daily, nay hourely thou omitteſt ſome dutie which thy God hath commanded thee, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteſt ſome ſinne which hee hath forbidden. Can therefore the Lord, who abhorreth wickedneſſe, loue the wicked? canſt thou obtaine his fauour, and yet doeſt nothing but diſpleaſe him? He that loueth God keepeth his commandements; but thou by tranſgreſſing them all, doeſt ſhew that thou loueſt him not: and will the Lord loue them who hate and rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? Can iuſtice it ſelfe loue wickednes, and perfect holineſſe impure corruption? No verely; for in his word hee
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:23802:82"/>hath threatned his wrath againſt all ſuch notorious ſinners, and hee is no leſſe true in his threatnings than in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
               <p>But if all this will not perſwade thee that the Lord abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thee, yet at leaſt bee perſwaded by thine owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc. For, hath not thy iuſt God begunne already to make thee taſte the cuppe of his wrath, of which hereafter thou ſhalt drinke in full meaſure; hath hee not ſpoyled thee of thy goods, taken away thy good name, made thee an abiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, afflicted thee in body with grieuous and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall ſickneſſe, and filled thy ſoule full of horror and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpayre? Is not thy conſcience ſtung with ſinne, and hath not the poyſon thereof drunke vp thy ſpirit? Doeſt thou not plainely apprehend his wrath, and is not thy ſoule as it were ſet vpon the racke, ſo that there is not one part of thee, either of body and ſoule which is not full of miſery and wretchedneſſe. Doe not therefore fondly flatter thy ſelfe with a vaine opinion of Gods loue, but beleeue, if not my words, yet at leaſt thine owne ſenſes; and ſeeing thou haſt no hope of Gods loue, if thou beeſt wiſe loue thy ſelfe, follow thy pleaſures, eate and drinke and cheere vp thine heart, and doe not vainely macerate and turmoyle thy ſelfe in labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after impoſſibilities, and in ſtriuing for the aſſurance of Gods loue, of which, when thou haſt done what thou canſt, yet ſhalt thou neuer be aſſured.</p>

The worldly man will ſay, that the Lord hath made him alſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of all theſe benefits, and therefore there is no cauſe why he ſhould doubt of his loue; nor any reaſon why he ſhould be cenſured or condemned for his faith. I anſwere, that he is not reprehended for his perſwaſion of Gods loue, nor for his aſſurance of Gods promiſes in Chriſt; but for his boaſting of this faith, perſwaſion, and aſſurance, whereas there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him in truth but a dead carcaſe of faith, carnall ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and vaine preſumption. For true faith purifieth the heart, Acts 15.9. and worketh by loue, Gal. 5.6. it is plentifull in good workes, and prouoketh vs to performe all good duties to God and our neighbours: and it is impoſſible that wee ſhould be truely perſwaded of Gods loue, and not loue him againe: it cannot be that we loue God, if we ſhew no care in glorifying his name, by letting our lights ſhine before men, nor any deſire to performe obedience to his will. For as our

If therefore we liue in our ſinnes without repentance, if we make no conſcience of our waies, and ſhew no zeale in glorifying Gods name; if our faith be deſtitute of the fruites of good workes, then is our perſwaſion but fond preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; our aſſurance, carnall ſecuritie; our faith dead, and like a carcaſe which breatheth not, as <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh, chap. 2.26. Wee doe not then reprehend any for being perſwaded of Gods loue, gathering his aſſurance out of Gods manifolde mercies, and innumerable benefits beſtowed on his Church: nay, contrariwiſe wee affirme that notwithſtanding all our ſinnes and vnworthineſſe, we are to be perſwaded of Gods loue in Chriſt, yea, and to beleeue againſt beleefe, and to hope againſt hope, when as there is no ground or reaſon of either in our ſelues: but this we maintaine, that whoſoeuer hath this aſſurance and faith, in the leaſt meaſure begunne in him, doth truly loue God againe, and earneſtly laboureth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mortification and newneſſe of life; and whoſoeuer is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Gods loue, and liueth in his ſinnes, without any ſorrowe for thoſe which are paſt, or purpoſe to leaue them for the time to come, he may well brag of his faith and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods loue, but in very trueth there is as yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him but carnall ſecuritie and vaine preſumption.</p>

To this we may anſwere, that though in their owne nature they be euill, yet through the wiſedome and gracious prouidence of our God, they turne to the good of his children; and though to the wicked they are plagues and puniſhments, yet to the godly they are but trials and fatherly chaſtiſements; for all their ſinnes are puniſhed in Chriſt, neither will it ſtand with Gods iuſtice to puniſh them againe in the faithful: and therfore there is no other end of them but the manifeſtation of Gods glory, and our ſpiritual good and euerlaſting ſaluation. For as they are trials they ſerue to ſhew vnto all the world, and eſpecially to our ſelues, our faith, hope, patience, obedience, conſtancie, and the reſt of the graces of Gods ſpirit, to the praiſe of his glory who hath beſtowed them, and to the comfort of our owne ſoules who haue receiued them. And as they are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements they ſerue for ſharpe eye-ſalues to cleere our dimme ſight, ſo as we may ſee our ſinnes, and truely repent of them. They ſerue for ſowre ſauces, to bring vs out of loue with our ſweete ſinnes, and for fire and files, whereby wee are purged and ſcoured from the droſſe and ruſt of our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They are ſharpe pruning kniues, to lop and trimme vs, that we may bring forth plentifull fruits in godlineſſe. They are ſpurres to pricke vs forward in the Chriſtian race, and hedges to keepe vs from wandering out of the way. They

In a word, they are the ſtraight path which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to euerlaſting happineſſe, and a bridle to reſtraine vs from running headlong in the broade way, which leadeth to endleſſe wo and miſerie. And therfore ſeeing our momentany afflictions do ſerue for the manifeſting of Gods glorie, for the increaſing of ſpirituall graces, and the furthering of our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation, let not Sathan perſwade vs that wee are out of Gods loue and fauour becauſe of our afflictions, but rather let vs repute them as they are indeede ſignes of his gracious prouidence and fatherly care which he hath ouer vs.</p>

Neither need this dealing of our heauenly Father ſeeme ſtrange vnto vs, ſeeing earthly parents take the ſame courſes with their children whom they tenderly loue; for when they offen them, they firſt ſeeke their amendment by words and fatherly admonitions; and when this will doe no good they proceed to blowes, and in a gentle manner do correct them; and if this preuaile not with them, then they vſe more ſharpe and ſeuere chaſtizement; but if all this be to no purpoſe,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:23802:91"/>then will they diſguiſe their fatherly affection vnder the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of wrath and heauie diſpleaſure; they baniſh out of their countenance all ſignes of loue, and aſſume terrible looks and bitter frownes; yea they will ſometimes thruſt them out of doores, and reiect them a while, leauing them to ſhift for themſelues, and to endure all miſerie. And whence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all this? ſurely not from hatred, but from loue and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care which they haue ouer them for their good.

But the truth is, that as Sathan tempting our Sauiour, and quoting ſcripture for his purpoſe, left out that which made againſt him; ſo here by his inſtruments aſſaulting his members, he addeth to the ſcriptures that which maketh for him: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Hebrew, which is the originall, nor in the Greeke tranſlation is there any one word of our worthineſſe or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe; but thus it is in the text as it is truly tranſlated in our Bibles; <hi>No man knoweth either loue or hatred of all that is before them:</hi> and whereas they reade the words following thus; <hi>But all things are kept vncertain for the time to come,</hi> they moſt groſly depraue the text, which is thus to be read as wee haue it tranſlated; <hi>All things come alike to all, and the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is to the iuſt and the wicked;</hi> and thus alſo doth <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> one of the moſt learned amongſt themſelues tranſlate it.</p>
               <p>Neither wil their corrupt tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtand with the ſenſe and truth of the place: for, as he ſaith, no man knoweth whether he be worthie of loue, ſo alſo, that no man knoweth whether he be worthie of hatred: but this is vtterly falſe; for ſo ſhould wee ſay that wee could not know whether the Sodomites for their filthineſſe, the Canaanites for their idolatrie, <hi>Iulian</hi> for his apoſtaſie were worthie to be hated of God; whereas the ſcriptures witneſſe the cleane contrarie, and euen they themſelues doe confeſſe, that they who deſperatly giue ouer
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:23802:97"/>themſelues into all ſinne and wickedneſſe, are not to doubt but that they are worthie of Gods anger and heauie diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; why therefore on the other ſide may not thoſe who are truly conuerted vnto God, and indued with a liuely faith which worketh by loue, be aſſured of Gods loue and fauour, ſeeing he hath aſſured them hereof in his word? Nay in the ſame chapter verſ. 7. their corrupt expoſition is ouerthrowne; for there he biddeth vs to <hi>eate our bread with ioy, and to drinke our wine with a cheereful heart, for God now accepteth our works.</hi> Now, though God did indeede accept ourworkes, yet wee could not be moued to ioy and cheerefulneſſe of heart here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, vnleſſe alſo we might be aſſured of his acceptation.</p>
               <p>But let vs examine theſe words and ſhew the true ſenſe of them.<note place="margin">The expoſition of Eccleſ. <hi>9.1.</hi>
                  </note> There are two expoſitions giuen, which may ſtand with the analogie of faith and the circumſtances of the text. For ſome vnderſtand theſe words not of Gods loue or hatred, but of mans loue towards thoſe things he deſires, and of his hatred towards thoſe things he flieth; and then this is the ſenſe of the place; A man knoweth not whether thoſe things which he loueth, as pleaſures, honours and riches, or thoſe things which hee hateth, namely croſſes and afflictions ſhall happen vnto him, becauſe they are not diſpoſed by his owne power, but by the prouidence of God who giueth theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things indifferently to all both iuſt and vniuſt. So that if the words are thus to be vnderſtood, there is no ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Papiſts expoſition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let it be granted that it is to be vnderſtood of Gods loue towards vs, yet it will make nothing for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for then this is the plaine ſenſe of the words; no man can know whether hee bee loued or hated of God by theſe common outward things which happen alike to al, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whereof there is the ſame condition to the iuſt and the wicked, and to the pure and polluted, to thoſe that worſhip God and thoſe that worſhip him not: there is no iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can bee giuen, either of our ſelues or others in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our outward ſtate, for ſometime the iuſt are poore, the vniuſtrich, the wicked aduanced to honour, and the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted and perſecuted. For example, <hi>Eſau</hi> enioyed his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:23802:97"/>delights and plentie of all things, <hi>Iacob</hi> like a poore pilgrime went into a ſtrange countrie, hauing no other riches but his clothes on his backe and his ſtaffe in his hand, &amp; when he was come amongſt his friends he endured tedious labours, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſeries; and ſo <hi>Dauid</hi> was perſecuted, whileſt <hi>Saul</hi> did ſit on the throne; yea our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe was arraigned at the barre and condemned, whileſt <hi>Pilate</hi> and the chiefe Prieſts and Phariſies ſate in the ſeate of iuſtice, ouerſwaying all at their owne pleaſures: and yet at the ſame time, <hi>Iacob</hi> was beloued, <hi>Eſau</hi> hated; <hi>Dauid</hi> choſen of God, <hi>Saul</hi> reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; our Sauiour Chriſt the deare ſonne of his heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his enemies the inſtruments and limmes of Sathan. So that it is moſt true that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh, namely, no man can haue aſſurance of Gods loue and fauour by theſe outward benefits beſtowed both vpon the godly and wicked; neither by his aduerſities and afflictions can gather that the Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him: for theſe befall all indifferently, as it pleaſeth God to puniſh the reprobate, or to chaſtize his owne children.</p>
               <p>But though we can gather no ſound argument from theſe outward things of Gods loue, yet it followeth not that there is no other meanes to aſſure vs hereof: for by the ſame reaſon wee may conclude that man is no better than brute beaſts, and that there is no immortalitie of the ſoule,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.19.</note> becauſe it is ſaid, Eccleſ. 3.19. that the condition of the children of men and the condition of beaſts is the ſame. But as the Wiſeman ſpeaketh there of their outward mortalitie alone, and not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely in all reſpects; and therefore he ſaith that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to ſee to, that is, in outward appearance, verſ. 18. and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth himſelfe in the words following; for (ſaith hee) as one dieth ſo dieth the other: ſo he doth not meane here ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that there is no aſſurance of Gods loue, but onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of theſe outward things, and therefore he addeth, that in theſe outward reſpects all things come alike to all, and the ſame condition is to the iuſt and the wicked.</p>
               <p>Though then there is no aſſurance of Gods loue to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of our worldly eſtate, yet it cannot hence be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that therefore there is no meanes whereby we may be aſſured hereof: for the Lord hath giuen vnto vs his word and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:23802:98"/>mercifull promiſes, he hath giuen vnto vs his holy ſpirit <hi>cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our harts Abba father, and witneſſing to our ſpirits that we are the ſonnes of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> Rom. 8. He hath manifeſted his loue by giuing vs his onely ſonne, and begetting in vs by his word and ſpirit a liuely faith, whereby wee may apply him and all his benefits vnto vs. Whoſoeuer therefore beleeueth truly in Ieſus Chriſt, he may be aſſured of Gods loue and euerlaſting life, according to that Ioh. 3.16. <hi>So God loued the world, that he gaue his onely begotten ſonne,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>If therefore we beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, we need not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, no nor to doubt of Gods loue and fauour towards vs; notwithſtanding our vnworthineſſe, nor yet in regard of the manifold afflictions which God inflicteth on vs, neither in reſpect of thoſe manifold infirmities which we bewray whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the hand of God is vpon vs: but wee may ſoundly and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly conclude with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.38. <hi>I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that neither death nor life,</hi>

               <p>And ſo much concerning the firſt cauſe of our ſaluation, namely Gods loue and goodwill, and alſo the temptations of Sathan, whereby hee laboureth to impugne our aſſurance thereof: the ſecond cauſe is Gods free election, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the other; for whom he loueth, thoſe hee elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto euerlaſting life and happineſſe, it being an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fruite of loue to ſeeke the good and felicitie of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie beloued.</p>

               <p>Secondly, the motiue or impulſiue cauſe of Gods election is expreſſed, namely, Gods free loue, meere goodwill and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerued grace. And this alſo is manifeſt Luk. 12.32. <hi>Feare not little flocke, for it is your fathers pleaſure to giue you a kingdome.</hi> And Eph. 1.5. who <hi>hath predeſtinated vs to be adopted through Ieſus Chriſt vnto himſelfe, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here therefore are excluded all other cauſes, wherewith di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers haue imagined God was moued to elect vs; as namely our owne will, the foreſeeing of our workes worthineſſe or faith, and the merits of our Sauiour Chriſt. And that theſe were not the cauſes which mooued the Lord to elect vs, it may be prooued by manifeſt teſtimonies of ſcripture. Firſt, our owne will is expreſſely excluded, Rom. 9.16. <hi>It is not in him that willeth or runneth, but in God that ſheweth mercie.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, not the foreſight of our owne workes, for the Apoſtle plainly affirmeth Rom. 9.11.12. that <hi>before the children were borne, and when they had neither done good or euill, that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God might remaine according to election, not by workes, but by him that calleth.</hi> 12. <hi>It was ſaid vnto her, the elder ſhall ſerue the younger,</hi> 13. <hi>As it is written, I haue loued Iacob and hated Eſau.</hi> And chap. 11.5.6. he ſaith, that <hi>Gods election is of grace, and if it be of grace it is no more of workes, or els were grace no more grace.</hi> Thirdly, not the foreſight of any worthineſſe in vs more than in others; <hi>For there is no difference, for all haue
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:23802:99"/>ſinned and are depriued of the glorie of God:</hi> as it is Rom. 3.23. And the Apoſtle affirmeth both of himſelfe and others, <hi>that they were all dead in their ſinnes, and by nature the children of wrath as well as others,</hi> Eph. 2.1.3. Fourthly, the Lord reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not our faith as an impulſiue cauſe mouing him to elect vs, but only as an effect of our election; neither was the Lord mercifull vnto vs in making choiſe of vs to bee partakers of euerlaſting happineſſe, becauſe we were faithfull, but, that we might be faithfull, as <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth of himſelfe 1. Cor. 7.25. And the holy Ghoſt affirmeth, Act. 13.46. that as many of the <hi>Gentiles as were ordained vnto eternall life beleeued.</hi> Laſtly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the merit of Chriſt was the onely meritorious cauſe of our ſaluation, yet it was not the cauſe of Gods election, for Gods election was from all eternitie, and the cauſe of Chriſts merits, which were in time and the effects of Gods election, and therefore that which came after could not be the cauſe of that which was from all eternitie, neither can the effect produce the cauſe, but the cauſe the effect. Moreouer, we are not ſaid in the ſcriptures to be choſen for Chriſt, but in Chriſt, Eph. 1.4. And the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> affirmeth, that Gods eternall loue was the cauſe which moued the Lord to ſend his ſonne to redeeme vs by his death, and not that his death was the cauſe of his loue, Ioh. 3.16. And ſo much concerning the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe of our election. The materiall cauſe thereof was the purpoſe or counſaile of God himſelfe, whereby hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to elect vs.</p>
               <p>The formall cauſe was the ſeuering and ſetting apart of certaine men which were to bee ſaued,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ Sect. </seg>2</label> ſelected from the reſt who were reiected.</p>
               <p>The end of Gods election was two-fold: the firſt and chief end was the glorie of God, ſet forth by manifeſting his grace and mercie in the ſaluation of the faithfull. And this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle plainly expreſſeth Rom. 9.23. namely, that the end of Gods election is, <hi>that he might declare the riches of his glorie in the veſſels of mercie, which he hath prepared vnto glorie.</hi> And Eph. 1.4, 5, 6. he ſaith, that <hi>he hath choſen vs in Chriſt, and prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated vs, to the praiſe of the glorie of his grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond end which is inferiour and ſubordinate to the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:23802:99"/>other, is the ſaluation of the elect, and this alſo is expreſſed by the Apoſtle Rom. 9.23. where hee ſaith, that the elect <hi>are prepared vnto glorie.</hi> And Act. 13.48. the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>as many as were ordained to eternall life:</hi> thereby implying that the ſaluation of the elect is the end of Gods election. And theſe are the cauſes of Gods election. The effects which inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably follow-hereupon, are Chriſt the Mediatour, and the whole worke of his mediation and our redemption wrought by him, our adoption, effectuall calling, iuſtification, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and glorification; and theſe are the degrees and meanes of our election, which are as well contained in Gods decree as our ſaluation it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The ſubiect in which we are elected, is Chriſt Ieſus our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour and head; not in regard of his deitie alone, for ſo he is the efficient cauſe; nor in reſpect of his humanitie alone, but as he is God and man. And wee are therefore elected in him, both becauſe in our ſelues we were not capable of ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious dignitie, as alſo becauſe hee alone is a fit Mediatour in whom we ſhould be elected, ſeeing with our election there is an vnion &amp; coniunction of vs with God who hath elected vs.</p>
               <p>The obiect of Gods election are all thoſe who are preor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained vnto euerlaſting life, and whom the Lord will eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaue; which being conſidered in themſelues are a great number, but yet in reſpect of the number of the reprobates but a ſmall and little flocke; for <hi>though many be called, yet few are choſen,</hi> as Chriſt himſelfe affirmeth, Matth. 22.14.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing, which alſo is expreſſed in the definition, are certaine properties attributed to Gods election; namely, that it is eternall, free and immutable. That this decree is eternall, it appeareth Eph. 1.4. <hi>He hath choſen vs in him before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world.</hi> So Rom. 9.11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it is free and of his meere grace, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Rom. 9.18. <hi>He hath mercie on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth.</hi> So Eph. 1.11. <hi>In whom we are choſen when wee were predeſtinate, according to the purpoſe of him which worketh all things after the counſaile of his owne will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, that it is immutable and moſt firme and certaine, it plainly appeareth 2. Tim. 2.19. <hi>The foundation of God remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:23802:100"/>ſure; and hath this ſeale, the Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> Where we may obſerue, that this immutabilitie and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Gods decree, doth not depend vpon vs or our perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but vpon Gods good pleaſure and foreknowledge, for it is a foundation in it ſelfe firme and ſtable, and hath not the ſeale of our worthineſſe or perſeuerance in grace, but of Gods foreknowledge whereby he knoweth who are his.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow concerning this decree of election and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance thereof, there are two ſorts of Sathans temptations: the firſt he ſuggeſteth into the minds of carnall worldlings, to nouriſh in them fond preſumption and carnall ſecuritie: the other, into the minds of weak chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whereby he moueth them to doubt &amp; deſpaire of their electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to euerlaſting life. The worldly man he aſſaulteth with two principal temptations: firſt, he perſwadeth him that there is no election at al or reprobation, but that all in the end ſhall be ſaued. Which groſſe abſurditie that hee may make more plauſible and probable, hee ſetteth before them the infinite mercie of God, and the generall promiſes and conſolations in the Goſpell:<note place="margin">Ezech. 13. and 18. 1. Tim. 2.4.</note> as, <hi>that he will not the death of a ſinner,</hi> and that he will <hi>that all men ſhall be ſaued,</hi> in both places cunningly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that which followeth; for to the firſt place is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but <hi>that he repent,</hi> and in the latter, that they <hi>who ſhall be ſaued muſt alſo come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this temptation is ſo palpably abſurd, that it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not Sathans policie to vſe it to any, but thoſe onely whoſe hearts are hardned, their eyes blinded, their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſeared, and who hauing not beleeued and loued the truth, are giuen ouer of God to beleeue ſtrong deluſions; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not ſpend much time in anſwering this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: onely let ſuch men as are ſeduced with Sathans lyes know thus much, that Gods mercie is a iuſt mercie, as his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:23802:100"/>is a mercifull iuſtice; that God is infinite in both, and no leſſe glorified in the manifeſtation of the one than of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let them know that there are no promiſes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſo generall, which are not limited with the condition of faith, and the fruite thereof vnfained repentance. Let them know, that God who is not onely mercifull but alſo true, yea truth it ſelfe, hath in his word reuealed his will, as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the eternall death and deſtruction of the wicked, as the ſaluation of the godly: he hath ſaid,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.14. and 7.13.</note> that <hi>many are called and few choſen;</hi> that the gate of heauen is ſo ſtraight, that there are few who finde it; that he will ſay to the workers of iniquitie, <hi>Goe your waies I know you not;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">23.</note> that hee will make a ſeparation betweene the ſheepe and the goates, and as hee ſaith to the one, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my father, inherit ye the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome prepared for you from the foundations of the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 25.34.41<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> ſo hee will ſay to the other, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into euerlaſting fire, which is prepared for the diuell and his angels.</hi> Let them know that neither <hi>fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor wantons, nor buggerers, not theeues, nor couetous,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.9.10.</note> 
                  <hi>nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners,</hi> nor any that liue in the like ſinnes, without repentance, <hi>ſhall inherit the kingdome of God,</hi> for truth it ſelfe hath ſpoken it, 1.

                  <hi>which is the ſecond death,</hi> as it is Reuel. 21.8.

Sect. </seg>2</label> The ſecond temptation which Sathan ſuggeſteth into the minds of carnall men, to the end they may runne on in their deſperate courſes, and wallow ſtill in the pleaſing filth of their corruptions, hee thus frameth; Why enioyeſt thou not (ſaith he) thy pleaſures? why art thou afraid to ſatisfie all thy deſires? what needeſt thou to take any paines in perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:23802:101"/>Gods worſhip and ſeruice,<note place="margin">Sathans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the vnchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods predeſtination.</note> and to what purpoſe ſhouldeſt thou forſake thy pleaſing ſinnes, ſtudying and ſtriuing after mortification and newneſſe of life, which is ſo bitter and vnpleaſant vnto thee? for Gods decree of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination is ſure and moſt vnchangeable as himſelfe is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out change, and therefore if thou art elected of God thou maieſt follow thy delights, goe on in thy ſinnes, liue as thou liſt, yet ſurely thou ſhalt be ſaued, and he will giue thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, though it be deferred to the laſt gaſpe. But if on the other ſide thou art a reprobate, reiected of God in his eternall councell, then take what paines thou wilt, make thy throte horce with praying, and thy bagges emptie with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing almes, be neuer ſo diligent in Gods ſeruice, neuer ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in mortifying thy ſins, yet all is in vaine, for thoſe whom he hath reprobated ſhall be condemned. And therefore much better were it to take thy pleaſure and to follow thine owne deſires whileſt thou art in this life: for the puniſhments of the life to come will be enough, though thou addeſt no torments of this life vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer temptation is both fooliſh and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous falſe and impious.</note>And thus doth Sathan reaſon in the minde of a carnall man, partly to continue and increaſe his ſecuritie in the courſe of ſinne, and partly to diſcredit the holy doctrine of Gods eternall predeſtination, as though it opened a dore to all licentiouſneſſe. But if we conſider of this temptation aright, and ſound it to the bottome, we ſhall finde firſt that it is moſt fooliſh and ridiculous, ſecondly that it is moſt falſe and impious. That it is moſt fooliſh it will eaſily appeare, if we vſe the like manner of reaſoning in worldly matters; for it is all one as if a man ſhould thus ſay: thy time is appointed, and the Lord in his counſaile hath ſet downe how long thou ſhalt liue; if therefore it be ordained that thy time ſhall be ſhort, vſe what meanes thou wilt of phiſicke and good diet, yet ſhalt thou not prolong it one day; but if God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that thou ſhalt liue to olde age, take what courſes thou wilt, runne into all deſperate daungers, vſe ſurfetting and all diſorder of diet, nay eate no meate at all, and yet thou ſhalt liue till thou art an old man. Or as if he ſhould ſay; God hath decreed alreadie whether thou ſhalt be rich or poore, and if
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:23802:101"/>he hath appointed thee to be poore, take neuer ſo much paines, follow thy calling as diligently as thou wilt, abſtaine from all waſtfulneſſe and prodigalitie, yet ſhalt thou neuer get any wealth: but if thou art preordained to be rich, ſell all thou haſt and ſcatter it abroade in the ſtreetes, ſpend thy time in gaming, drinking and whoring, neuer troubling thy head with care, nor thy hands with worke, yet ſhalt thou be a welthie man. Now who would not laugh at ſuch abſurd manner of reaſoning if any ſhould vſe it? becauſe euery man knoweth, that as God hath decreed the time of our life, ſo he hath decreed alſo that we ſhould vſe the meanes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our liues may be preſerued ſo long as he hath ordained that we ſhould liue, namely auoyding of daungers, good diet, and phiſicke; and as he hath decreed that a man ſhould be rich, ſo he hath decreed alſo that he ſhould vſe all good meanes of attaining vnto riches, namely prouidence and paines in getting, and care and frugalitie in keeping that he hath gotten; and whoſoeuer vſe not the meanes, doe make it manifeſt that they were not ordained vnto the end. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeede, becauſe the Lord would ſhew his abſolute and almightie power, he doth not alwaies tie himſelfe vnto meanes, but ſometimes croſſeth and maketh them vneffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to their ends, and ſometime he effecteth what he will, without or contrarie to all meanes; and hence it is that ſome quickly die who vſe all meanes to preſerue health, and ſome become poore who vſe al meanes of obtaining riches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others being depriued of the meanes attaine vnto long life and riches by the immediate bleſſing of God. But ordinarily the meanes and end goe together, and therefore it is fond preſumption to imagine or hope, without the vſe of the meanes, to attaine vnto the end. And thus it is alſo in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall matters appertaining to euerlaſting life; thoſe whom God hath elected, he hath ordained alſo that they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto and vſe all good meanes tending thereunto, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, repentance, ſanctification, and newneſſe of life: and therefore it is as abſurd for any to imagine, that they ſhall be ſaued continuing in their ignorance, infidelitie, vnrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie, and filthie corruptions, as it is for a man to thinke that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:23802:102"/>he ſhall liue to be old, and yet runneth into all daungers, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh phiſicke yea and foode alſo whereby his life ſhould be ſuſtained. For the ſpirituall meanes of ſaluation are as well (nay much more) contained in Gods decree, as the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meanes of preſeruing life: for it hath been heard-of, that ſome haue liued in the middeſt of daungers, and in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of meate, for a long time; but it was neuer heard that any haue attained vnto euerlaſting life without faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſanctification: for euen the thiefe vpon the croſſe beleeued in Chriſt, and ſhewed the fruites of his faith in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his owne ſinne reproouing his fellow, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing our Sauiour Chriſt euen then when his Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and forſooke him, in calling vpon his name and deſiring by his meanes euerlaſting life.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The ſecond end of Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>The ſecond end of Gods election is the ſaluation of his elect; for the iuſt accompliſhing whereof, he hath preordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diuers ſubordinate cauſes or meanes, which are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable effects and fruites of his election; all which are ſo linked one with another, as that the precedent meanes is the cauſe of that which next in order followeth, and Gods decree the cauſe of all. The effects of Gods election, which are the ſubordinate cauſes or meanes of our ſaluation, are principally three; Vocation, Iuſtification, and Sanctification. By vocation we are ſeparated from the world, made mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, &amp; ingrafted in to the body of Chriſt; and this is ordinarily done by the preaching of the word being made effectual by the inward operation of Gods ſpirit, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily by ſome other meanes, or immdiately by the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of the holy Ghoſt. In our iuſtification we haue the pardon and remiſſion of all our ſinnes by vertue of Chriſts merit, and are adorned with his righteouſneſſe imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: and this is done, principally by God himſelfe, &amp; inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally by a liuely faith. Our ſanctification conſiſteth in our dying to ſin, and riſing vp to newnes of life; which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, increaſed, and finiſhed in vs by Gods ſpirit. Whoſoeuer therefore are predeſtinate to ſaluation, they alſo are effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, that is ſeparate from the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ingrafted into the body of Chriſt; and this they attaine vnto by diligent and attentiue hearing of the word. Whoſoeuer are effectually called, are alſo iuſtified; and therefore haue obtained a true and liuely faith. Whoſoeuer are iuſtified are alſo ſanctified, that is, die vnto their ſinnes, and riſe againe to newnes of life,

So that where the one is, there the other is; where the one neuer is, there the other ſhall euer be wanting. And therefore as by our ſanctification, iuſtification, and vocation, wee may certainly conclude that we are elected and ſhall be ſaued; ſo if we be without theſe, wee may as certainly inferre that wee are reiected, and ſhall be condemned if wee liue and die in this ſtate.</p>
               <p>Seeing then this is Gods truth, let not Sathan lull vs in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie with that ſophiſticall cauill; if wee be elected we ſhall be ſaued liue how wee liſt; if we be reprobates wee ſhall be condemned, be we neuer ſo earneſt in labouring after godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for theſe principles may well ſtand together, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the elect ſhould periſh, and as impoſſible alſo that any who beleeue not in Chriſt, and bring not foorth the fruites of their faith in a godly and Chriſtian life ſhould bee ſaued; it cannot bee that the reprobate ſhould attaine vnto euerlaſting happineſſe, and that any ſhould not attaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, who deſireth and endeuoureth to ſerue and feare the Lord: becauſe predeſtination and ſaluation are ſo coupled together with the meanes that come betweene them, that they cannot poſſibly be ſeuered from one another, nor the meanes from either of them, nor yet amongſt themſelues; euen as the firſt lincke of a chaine is ioyned with the laſt by thoſe which are betweene them, and theſe which are in the middle one with another.</p>

So theſe one while hope, and ſoone after finding their owne infirmities, and not ſeeing where they may reſt their wauering minds, doubt and feare, till at laſt through wearineſſe they ſinke downe and are ſwallowed vp in the gulfe of deſperation, where they are drowned and deſtroyed, if it doe not pleaſe the Lord to lift them vp again, and to ſhew them the firme Rock Ieſus Chriſt, whereupon they may reſt their wearie mindes and refreſh their fainting ſoules; which hee alwaies doth perfourme to thoſe that belong to his election; for it is impoſſible that any of them ſhould periſh, though Sathan and all the power of hell ſeeke their ruine and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>But at this marke Sathan aimeth though hee neuer hitteth it, and though he neuer finally preuaile, yet to this doubting, and in the end deſpairing, he laboureth to perſwade the true Chriſtian; neither doth hee content himſelfe with the forces of his owne temptations, but he ioyneth with him the world, which is as readie as Sathan himſelfe to oppugne the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:23802:104"/>of our election, and our owne trayterous fleſh which is eaſily moued to doubting and deſpaire, when as it ſeeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it ſelfe whereupon it may reſt. In the world he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his choiſe not of ſillie ignorant men, but of the moſt ſubtill Sophiſters and learned Doctors, the true ſucceſſors of the Scribes and Phariſies, euen the whole rabble of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh clergie; who ſtand on Sathans part ſtoutly fighting his battailes, being perſwaded and ouercome by that tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which our Sauiour Chriſt withſtood, <hi>All this will I giue thee.</hi> For to what end (I pray you) doe theſe great Doctors ſo ſtifly ſtand in the defence of Sathans cauſe, perſwading men might and maine to doubt of their election, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of their ſaluation? Surely that by emptying mens minds of all true comfort, they may fill their own cheſts, and get the treaſures of the earth into their poſſeſſions. For when the weake conſcience wauereth and doubteth of his election, and not finding any true conſolation whereupon it may reſt, commeth vnto them for ſome comfort and better aſſurance; they behaue themſelues like vnto vngracious Surgeons, who intending to make a pray of their patients, and to get their gains out of their pains and tortures, do one day heale, and the next day hinder the cure, making the wound worſe than it was whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they took it in hand, til at laſt they haue ſo poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſore that it is paſt their cure, whereas they could eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue healed it, if they had not regarded their profit more than their own credit, or their patients health: or like vnto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull Lawyers, who ſomtimes ſpeake in their clients cauſe, and ſometimes betray it, going about in a tedious circuit, whereas the direct way lieth open before them, that ſo their clients cauſe being made more doubtfull &amp; tedious, &amp; them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues impatient of delaies, are faine to double and trebble their fees, and yet oftentimes to no purpoſe, becauſe the more they receiue, the fitter they thinke them to be their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Clients. So doe theſe Popiſh Chirurgeons and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh counſailers deale with their Pacient and Client; for ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing his wounded conſcience, and deſiring ſome comfort at their hands, they will not make any ſoueraigne ſalue of the ſimples which they might gather out of Gods word, whereby
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:23802:104"/>he might ſoone be healed, for then their cure, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their gaines were at an ende: but they holde him in ſuſpenſe, and increaſe his diſeaſe of doubting, applying thereunto poyſons in ſtead of ſalues, whereby at laſt his wound is made deſperate. Thou canſt not (will they ſay) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto any certaine aſſurance of thine election, for that were fond preſumption; but thou art to hope well: and that thou maiſt confirme thy hope, thou muſt make vowes and goe on pilgrimage, to inuocate and offer vnto theſe and theſe ſaints, thou muſt doe theſe workes of ſupererogation, build ſuch a Monaſtery, repaire ſuch a Church, giue ſo much money to ſuch a Cloiſter, buie theſe Indulgences, whereby thou maiſt receiue pardon for thy ſinnes; and for more ſurety ſake, thou ſhalt at thy death bequeath ſo much money to the Prieſts, for Maſſes, Trentals and Dirges, that if it happen thou goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Purgatorie, thou maiſt ſpeedely be deliuered: but all this while they ſpeake not a word of Gods vndeſerued grace and free election, not a ſyllable of Chriſts death and ſatisfaction for our ſinnes; no, this were too ſoueraigne a ſalue, and would too ſoone heale the wounded conſcience, and ſo marre the market of theſe mount-bankes, making their Vowes, Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, Maſſes, Dirges, Indulgences, and other trumpery-ware not worth the cheapning.</p>

We hold that a man truly conuerted, indued with a liuely faith and ſanctified, may ordinarily be aſſured that he is the child of God, elected to ſaluation: but they affirme that it is preſumption for ſuch to haue any certaine aſſurance hereof, vnleſſe it be by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reuelation; he may hope indeede that he is elected and ſhall be ſaued, but this hope muſt he tempered with feare, and mixt with doubting; and this doubting they call humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which they doe not account an infirmitie, but rather a vertue which doth commend their faith, eſteeming firme aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to be but hereticall confidence and damnable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and pronouncing him accurſed in their councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> who affimeth that we are to beleeue without doubting
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:23802:105"/>the remiſſion of our owne ſinne and euerlaſting life in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>And becauſe they cannot but confeſſe, that doubting and beleeuing, in themſelues are oppoſed one againſt another; they teach, that their faith is aſſured of Gods mercy and Chriſts merits, as in themſelues infinite and ſufficient; but it doubteth (in reſpect of our vnworthineſſe and manifold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections) to apply them particularly vnto our ſelues: ſo that when we looke vpon God and Chriſt, there is cauſe of firme aſſurance, but when we looke vpon our ſelues, there is nothing but matter of doubting, there is in deed ſome place left to their ſtaggering hope, but none to aſſurance of faith: as though our faith were grounded on our owne worthineſſe, and not vpon Gods free mercy and Chriſts merits; and as though reſting vpon theſe alone, it could not haue certaine aſſurance of our election and ſaluation, notwithſtanding our vnworthineſſe and corruptions. But let vs arme our ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this their doctrine, which containeth nothing elſe but principles whereupon ſathan may ground his temptations, whereby he perſwadeth vs firſt to doubting, and afterwards to deſpairing of our election and ſaluation; for when the troubled conſcience hath no other aſſurance of Gods loue and his owne election, but that which is gathered from his owne worthineſſe and workes, he ſtill doubteth whether yet he be worthy, or haue fulfilled the meaſure of workes requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and then further examining himſelfe to cleare his doubt, and finding his beſt workes exceeding imperfect, and that his ſinnes and corruptions are innumerable, then is his conſcience ſet vpon the racke, and his ſoule plunged into deepe deſpaire, hauing no other ſtay but the broken ſtaffe of his owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, which moſt deceiueth him when he moſt truſteth to it.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:23802:105"/>Secondly, I will ſhew the meanes whereby we may attaine vnto this aſſurance; and the infallible ſignes of our election. Laſtly, I will anſwere ſuch obiections as are made againſt it by ſathan and his adherents.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That we may be certainly aſſured of our election, proued by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Scriptures.</note>Concerning the firſt, namely, that we may be certainely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of our election and ſaluation, it may be proued by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Scriptures, and alſo by infallible reaſons groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon them. For we muſt not thinke that we can haue this aſſurance, by aſcending into heauen, and there ſearching into Gods ſecret decree, but we muſt gather it out of Gods word, wherein the Lord hath reuealed his will vnto vs: and in regard hereof, though Gods will in it ſelfe be ſecret, ſo that we may aske <hi>who hath knowne the will of the Lord?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.16.</note> yet ſeeing the Lord hath reuealed his hidden will in his word, we may ſay with <hi>Paul, that we haue knowne the minde of Christ.</hi> Now this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods will concerning our election, is not to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the lawe, as the Papiſts would haue it; for by reaſon of the condition annexed to the promiſe of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life <hi>(Doe this and liue)</hi> it leaueth our conſciences in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall doubting, nay, rather in vtter deſperation, becauſe we knowe that we are farre from the exact obedience thereof: but out of the gracious promiſes of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">The couenant of grace made to aſſure vs of our election.</note> freely made to euery one who beleeueth, without any condition of our owne workes and worthineſſe. And therefore if wee beleeue the promiſes of the Goſpell made in Chriſt, we may be aſſured of our election and ſaluation, though in our ſelues we are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſinners, who haue tranſgreſſed all Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for the couenant and promiſes of God made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his ſeede, was not <hi>through the lawe, but through the righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi> as it is Rom 4.13. and therefore it is by faith, that it might come by grace, and the promiſe might be ſure, not in ſelfe onely, and in reſpect of the ſufficiencie of Gods mercie and Chriſts merits, as the Papiſts dreame; but to all the ſeede, that is, to all that beleeue, and be the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was the father of the faithfull both Iew and Gentill. For otherwiſe we ſhould haue no better aſſurance of ſaluation by the Goſpell than by the Law; for euen the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Law was moſt ſure in it ſelfe and on Gods part,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:23802:106"/>yet not ſure to vs who could not perfourme the condition: and therefore the Lord made a new couenant, not of workes but of grace, onely on the condition of faith; that ſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe might be ſure, not onely in it ſelfe and on Gods behalf, but alſo vnto vs who are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede, that is, true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, as appeareth Rom. 4.16. And this alſo notably appeareth Heb. 6.17.18. where the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.16. Heb. 6.17.18.</note> that God <hi>willing more abundantly to ſhew vnto the heires of promiſe the ſtablenes of his counſaile, bound himſelfe by an oath,</hi> 18. <hi>That by two immutable things wherein it is impoſſible that God ſhould lie, wee might haue ſtrong conſolation, which haue our refuge to hold faſt the hope that is ſet before vs,</hi> 19. <hi>Which we haue as an anchor of the ſoule both ſure and ſtedfaſt.</hi> In which words the Apoſtle plainly ſheweth, that the Lord hath added his oath to his promiſe, not to the end that in it ſelf it ſhould be confirmed, or needed any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation on Gods part (for his bare word is yea and Amen, ſo infallible and ſure, that though <hi>heauen and earth paſſe away and periſh, yet not one iot or title of his word ſhall faile till all things be fulfilled</hi>) but to the end that we to whom the promiſes are made,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.18.</note> might be aſſured of the ſtableneſſe of his counſaile, and thereby receiue ſtrong conſolation, and might reſt our ſoules in the tempeſts of temptations vpon firme hope, as it were vpon a ſtedfaſt and ſure anchor. Now what ſtabilitie, what ſtrong conſolation, what ſtedfaſtneſſe of hope, if wee are ſtill vncertaine of our election, ſometimes hoping, as when wee looke vpon Gods mercie and Chriſts merits, and ſometimes doubting, as when wee looke vpon our owne ſinnes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe? For what is this but to be ſhaken from our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor hold, and to be toſſed vp and downe with the waues of doubting, till at laſt wee daſh againſt the rockes of deſpaire, and ſo make ſhipwrack of our ſoules?</p>

Rom. 5.1. it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> that being <hi>iustified by faith, wee haue peace towards God
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:23802:106"/>through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> But what peace can we haue, if wee be not aſſured of our election, but haue our mindes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted and racked betweene faith and doubting, hope and deſpaire? Rom. 8.38. the Apoſtle profeſſeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.38.</note> that <hi>he is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, &amp;c. nor any other creature ſhould be able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi> It is true (wil the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſay) that <hi>Paul</hi> had this aſſurance of his election and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it was by ſome ſpeciall reuelation, and nor ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; and therefore it followeth not hereof that euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſtian can haue this aſſurance. I anſwere, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle groundeth not his faith on reuelations in that place, but on a foundation common to him with all true Chriſtians, namely on the death of Chriſt, verſ. 32.<note place="margin">Verſ. 23.33.34.</note> on Gods free iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ver. 33. and vpon Chriſts interceſſion, ver. 34. and from hence hee confirmeth his and our reſolution, that nothing ſhould ſeparate vs from the loue of Chriſt, verſ. 35. from the loue of God in him. Whoſoeuer therefore with <hi>Paul</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that Chriſt died for him, that God freely iuſtifieth him through Chriſts merits, and that our Sauiour fitteth at the right hand of his Father to make interceſſion for him, he may be aſſured of Gods loue, and conſequently of his election. Secondly, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh this not of himſelfe alone, but alſo of all the faithfull, and therefore he vſeth the plurall number, <hi>I am perſwaded that nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate vs.</hi> So Eph. 3.12. the Apoſtle ſaith, that wee haue through Chriſt <hi>boldneſſe and entrance with confidence by faith in him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 3.12. Heb. 4.16. and 10.22.</note> And Heb. 4.16. he <hi>exhorteth vs to goe boldly vnto the throne of grace, that wee may receiue mercie &amp;c.</hi> And chap. 10.22. <hi>Let vs draw neere with a true heart in aſſurance of faith, &amp;c.</hi> But I would faine know what entrance with confidence, what boldneſſe and aſſurance of faith, when we draw neere vnto God, and preſent our ſelues before his throne of maieſtie, if we remaine doubtfull of his loue and our election? So Heb. 6.19. he ſaith that <hi>our hope is a ſure and ſtedfaſt anchor of the ſoule;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6.19.</note> but what certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or ſtedfaſtnes is there in it, if it wauer and ſtagger through doubtfulnes, ſo often as wee looke vpon our ſinnes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe? The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alſo doth tell vs, that the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:23802:107"/>truſt which we haue through Ieſus Chriſt muſt <hi>be perfect,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.13.</note> that is, <hi>entire and perpetuall, till we enioy the thing which we hope for,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.13. And 2. Pet. 1.10, he exhorteth vs <hi>to vſe all diligence that we may make our calling and election ſure:</hi> which if we could not doe, he ſhould perſwade vs to the vndertaking of a needeleſſe labour. Nay he plainely aſſureth vs, that <hi>if we doe theſe things (to wit if we ioyne vertue with our faith, and with vertue knowledge, and with knowledge temperance, and with temperance patience, and with patience godlineſſe, and with godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe brotherly kindneſſe, and with brotherly kindneſſe loue) we ſhall neuer fall;</hi> becauſe theſe are effects and vndoubted ſignes of our election. And the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> would not haue it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doubtfull, whether we are elected and ſhall be ſaued or no; but certainely knowne and vndoubtedly beleeued: and therefore he aimeth principally at this marke, and propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this as the chiefe end of his epiſtle, namely to ſhew how we might know ordinarily, and be fully aſſured that we are beloued of God,<note place="margin">1.

Ioh. 3.14. <hi>We know that we are tranſlated from death to life becauſe we loue the brethren.</hi> And therefore in the latter end of his epiſtle he ſaith, that he had written it to this end, that <hi>we might know that we haue eternall life.</hi> chap. 5.13.<note place="margin">and 5.13.</note> Seeing then the Scriptures doe commend vnto vs a ſtedfaſt and aſſured faith, whereby we particularly are aſſured and perſwaded of our election and ſaluation, notwithſtanding our ſinnes and vnworthineſſe: therefore let not the tempter perſwade vs to caſt away this certaine perſwaſion, and to wauer in doubting; but let vs ſay with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> 2.

I anſwere that this conſequence is falſe: for out of a generall and indefinit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, we may truely and by the lawes of reaſon gather and inferre a particular concluſion, though not contrariwiſe. For example, if I thus conclude; all men are reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:23802:107"/>but I am a man; therefore I am a reaſonable creature: it is rightly and truely inferred.

I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that it cannot be denied but that many are deceiued, by contenting themſelues with their carnall ſecuritie, in ſtead of a liuely faith; but hence it followeth not, that becauſe many are deceiued with an opinion of faith, therefore thoſe that beleeue indeede cannot be aſſured that they haue faith;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:23802:108"/>no more then this followeth, ſome men dreame that they are rich, and are not ſo indeede when they awake, therefore no man knoweth whether he be rich or no; for what is their ſecure opinion, but an idle dreame of their owne braines, which hath no warrant out of Gods word? where as faith cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely and euidently perſwadeth, and like a candle doth not only manifeſt other things, but alſo it ſelfe appeareth by his owne light. So that as a man who ſeeth and feeleth the fier and the heate thereof, doth certainly know that hee ſeeth and feeleth it, ſo he that beleeueth in Chriſt doth know that he beleeueth indeede: yea as much more certaine is this knowledge, as the knowledge of faith grounded vpon Gods word which is infallible, is more certaine than the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſenſes, which are often deceiued. Furthermore if we could not be aſſured that we haue faith, then to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſerues the admonition of the Apoſtle 2. Cor. 13.5.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Try your ſelues whether you are in the faith, examine your ſelues: know you not your owne ſelues, how that Ieſus Chriſt is in you except ye be reprobates?</hi> In which words the Apoſtle plainely implieth, that we may know that we haue a true and liuely faith, or els this triall and examination were vaine: nay hee plainely ſaith that we may know that Chriſt is in vs, except we be reprobates, and conſequently that we haue faith; for this onely is the hand whereby we apply Chriſt vnto vs and all his benefits.<note place="margin">1.

Cor. 11.28. the Apoſtle willeth vs to examine our ſelues before we come to the Lords table, that ſo we be not vnworthie gueſts; in which examination the chiefe thing which we are to reſpect, is whether we haue a true faith; for this is the mouth of the ſoule, whereby we feede vpon the body and blood of our Sauiour Chriſt; and therefore vnleſſe we can know whether we haue faith when we are truely indued therewith, this admonition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle were to no purpoſe; neither can we haue any aſſurance to our owne ſoules, that we are worthie gueſts of the Lords table, and conſequently we reſt doubtfull whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacrament to our ſpirituall good and ſaluation, or to our iudgement and condemnation.

If therefore we cannot be aſſured that we haue faith, we can haue no aſſurance that our beſt actions, our calling vpon Gods name, our hearing of his word, and all other duties of pietie and iuſtice, are any better than ſinnes and odious in Gods ſight: whereof it muſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that theſe actions, how good ſo euer in themſelues, will be done of vs in doubting, becauſe we know not whether they be done in faith; and being done doubtingly they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſinnes indeede, and therefore diſpleaſing in Gods ſight.

To this ſuggeſtion we are to anſwere, that we doe not ſay that the weake chriſtian may be aſſured at all times, that he hath faith by his preſent ſenſe; for firſt when we are newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, and the ſeedes of faith are ſowne in our hearts, we doe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:23802:109"/>not preſently diſcerne it; but as the corne which is caſt into the ground, is for a time couered and after ſpringeth vp the blade, and then the eare; ſo faith being ſowen in our hearts, which firſt like fallow grounds are plowed vp, and as it were harrowed and broken with the threatnings of the law, and apprehenſion of Gods anger due vnto our ſinnes, doth in the time of our humiliation and contrition, lie couered ſo as we cannot diſcerne it, till being more and more watered with the water of the ſpirit, and the heauenly promiſes of the Goſpell, which in the preaching of the word, like ſweete dewes and pleaſant ſhowers diſtill vpon it, it ſendeth forth the blade, namely an holy deſire and earneſt indeauour to ſerue God, and afterwards the fruite, euen a plentifull har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt in godlineſſe and righteouſneſſe of life.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, ſometime after that faith is begun in vs, and we haue ſeene the frutes thereof to our comfort, it is after hid from vs againe, as when either we wounde our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by committing ſome grieuous ſinne againſt knowledge wittingly and willingly, or when it pleaſeth the Lord to exerciſe vs in the ſpirituall conflict of temptations; for then ſometimes it commeth to paſſe that our faith for a time lieth hid vnder the aſhes of our corruptions; and the cloude of our ſinnes, and the apprehenſion of Gods anger, doth ſo ouerſhadow the eyes of our vnderſtanding that we cannot diſcerne the beames of Gods loue and fauour ſhining vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs; although when the conflict is ended, our faith againe flameth out in the loue of God, and zeale of his glorie, and the louing countenance of the Lord ſhineth graciouſly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs when theſe cloudes of temptations are ouerpaſt. And therefore though we do not certainely know our faith by the fruites therof, either ſoone after our conuerſion, or in the time of temptation, yet this muſt not diſcourage vs, becauſe theſe are no fit times to iudge thereof: onely when we want this knowledge and full aſſurance, let vs vſe all good meanes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God that we may attaine thereunto if we neuer had it; or recouer and againe renew it, if after we haue once had it, we loſe the ſenſe and feeling thereof, either by falling into hainous ſinnes, or by the violence of Sathans temptations.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus haue I ſhewed by plaine teſtimonies of ſcriptures,<note place="margin">Firſt, becauſe the Goſpell ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly ſheweth that we are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> that we may infallibly be aſſured of our election; now I will alſo prooue the ſame by ſtrong arguments, drawne from the ſame fountaine. Firſt therefore we may thus reaſon; Whatſoeuer is manifeſtly ſhewed vnto vs in the Goſpel, that we are bound to beleeue, and of that we may be aſſured: but it is manifeſtly declared in the Goſpel, that wee are elected vnto euerlaſting life: and therefore we are bound to beleeue it, and may be aſſured that we are elected. The propoſition or firſt part of this reaſon containeth two branches: the firſt is, that we are bound to beleeue whatſoeuer the Goſpell reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; the ſecond, that we may be aſſured of it; both which are euident truths. For that which Chriſt commandeth, that wee are bound to perfourme: but he commandeth vs to beleeue the Goſpell, Mar. 1.15. <hi>Repent and beleeue the Goſpell.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 1.15. 1. Ioh. 3.23.</note> So <hi>this is his commandement that we beleeue &amp;c.</hi> 1. Ioh. 3.23. The breach of which commandement is puniſhed with euerlaſting death. <hi>For he that will not beleeue ſhall be damned,</hi> as it is Mar.<note place="margin">Mar. 16.16.</note> 16.16. And as we are bound to beleeue it, ſo wee may alſo come to be aſſured thereof; ſeeing the Goſpell commandeth vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which it doth not alſo by the inward and ordinarie cooperation of Gods ſpirit enable vs to perfourme. For this difference is betweene the commandements of the Law and the commandements of the Goſpell: the Law ſheweth vs the duties which we ſhould perfourme, but miniſters vnto vs no power whereby wee may be enabled to perfourme them; but the Goſpell being aſſiſted with the operation of Gods ſpirit, doth command and withall giueth vs abilitie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme the commandement, for the words of the Goſpell <hi>are ſpirit and life,</hi> as our Sauiour ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.63.</note> 6.63. and with the preaching thereof the ſpirit inwardly worketh, quickning
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:23802:110"/>and ſtrengthening vs to perfourme that which it enioyneth. The aſſumption or ſecond part of the reaſon is alſo cleere, namely, that the Goſpell manifeſteth vnto vs our election; for what els is the whole Goſpell but a declaration of Gods loue, and of our election and redemption in and by Ieſus Chriſt? what is it els but the ambaſſage whereby God recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileth vs vnto himſelfe? what els is contained therein, but Gods mercifull promiſes of life and ſaluation, made on no other condition but on the condition of faith, which we need not feare to perfourme, ſeeing it is commanded vs of God? and therefore though we had no other reaſon to beleeue, yet wee ſhould beleeue in obedience to Gods commandement, ſeeing, he commandeth nothing which is not good in it ſelfe, tending to his owne glorie and our ſaluation; and if we doe beleeue, though our vnworthineſſe bee neuer ſo great, yea though our faith bee neuer ſo weake and ſmall, yet may wee thereby be aſſured of our election and ſaluation; for this is Gods <hi>will,</hi>

So it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4.20.</note> 
                  <hi>that he doubted not of Gods promiſe through vnbeleefe, but was ſtrengthened in the faith,</hi> Rom. 4.20. where the Apoſtle ſheweth, that doubting is a fruite of vnbeleefe and not a commendable vertue; nay, hee oppoſeth it to faith, ſaying, that hee doubted not of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but was ſtrengthened in the faith. So the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> chap. 1.5. ſaith, <hi>If any man lacke wiſedome,</hi>

                  <hi>let him aske in faith and wauer not;</hi> where he oppoſeth faith to wauering or doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And our Sauiour Chriſt alſo maketh this oppoſition, Matth, 21.21. ſaying, <hi>If ye haue faith and doubt not.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 21.21.</note> So that though faith and doubting are not oppoſed in reſpect of the ſubiect wherein they are, for euen the moſt deare children of God haue their faith often mixt with doubting, they being partly fleſh and partly ſpirit; yet theſe two in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:23802:111"/>are oppoſed one againſt the other; and euen in reſpect of their ſubiect they thus far diſagree, that though they haue their ſubſiſtance in the ſame ſubiect, yet not in the ſame part; that is, though they be in the ſame man, yet not in the ſame part, for faith is in the regenerate and ſpirituall part, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the vnregenerate or fleſhly part.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Matth. 14.31.</note> 
                  <hi>wherefore diddeſt thou doubt?</hi> And Luk. 12.29. he telleth vs that wee muſt not ſtand in doubt, or (as the word <gap reason="foreign">

And <hi>Paul</hi> is ſo farre from commending doubting for a vertue, that hee doth not onely condemne it as a ſinne in it ſelfe, but alſo as a cauſe which maketh our actions which are indifferent or good in themſelues to become ſinnes. So the eating of this or that meate is a thing indifferent and lawfull if it be recciued with prayer and thankſgiuing, but yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle telleth vs Rom. 14.23. that he <hi>who doubteth is condemned if he eate;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note> and he rendreth this reaſon, <hi>becauſe he eateth not of faith, and whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne.</hi> So that by this hee ſheweth, that he who doubteth, eateth not of faith; and that whatſoeuer is not done of faith is ſinne. Seeing therefore doubting is oppoſed vnto faith, and is in it ſelfe not onely a ſinne, but alſo a cauſe of ſinne; let vs not intertaine it though it bring letters commendatorie from the Pope and all his ſhauelings; but labour to baniſh it out of our harts, and ſtriue after faith and full aſſurance of our election and ſaluation in Chriſt Ieſus; and though we finde our great vnworthineſſe of the leaſt of Gods mercies, and cannot ſee any reaſon in our ſelues why we ſhould beleeue that wee are elected and ſhall be ſaued, yet let vs hope againſt hope, and beleeue againſt beleefe, for it is not a thing left to our choiſe but inioyned vs
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:23802:111"/>by God, as the chiefe and maine dutie required in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: and therefore laying aſide all reaſoning and diſputing, let vs reſolue to beleeue in obedience to Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and then though we are neuer ſo full of corruptions,<note place="margin">Act. 15.9.</note> yet will this faith purifie vs; though wee are moſt backward in perfourming any good worke, yet will it be fruitfull in vs,<note place="margin">Galat. 5 6.</note> and will worke by loue; though wee be moſt vnworthie, it will make vs more worthie, by applying vnto vs the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt and the merits of his death and bloudſhed, which will not onely free vs from the guilt and puniſhment of ſinne, but wil alſo purge vs from the vices and corruptions themſelues.</p>

Now, <hi>Abraham</hi> was not onely a bare beleeuer, but the father of the faithfull; neither was his faith propounded vnto vs as a wonder to admire at, but as an example for all his ſonnes to imitate.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:23802:113"/>in his ſeede Chriſt.

                  <hi>thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee.</hi> And therefore the faith which is now begot in vs by the Preaching of the word, doth alſo particularly perſwade vs of the remiſſion of our ſinnes and eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. For as our Sauiour Chriſt by his owne abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, did remit the ſinnes of thoſe that did beleeue; ſo he hath left this authoritie to his miniſters (not abſolutely by their owne power to remit ſinnes, which the man of ſinne doth chalenge vnto himſelfe, but) to declare and pronounce their ſinnes forgiuen who truly beleeue in the ſonne of God, and repent them of their ſinnes: the which their ſentence is ratified in Heauen, according to that Matth. 16.19.<note place="margin">Matth. 16.19.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 20.23.</note> 
                  <hi>and whoſe ſinnes ſo euer yee retaine, they are retained.</hi> So that, the Miniſters of Gods word, by the Preaching thereof, may aſſure men par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the remiſſion of their ſinnes: for when he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this generall propoſition, whoſoeuer beleeueth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth him of his ſinnes ſhall haue them remitted, and bee made an heyre of euerlaſting life; and the particular hearer doth truely aſſume that he beleeueth and repenteth, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath authoritie giuen him of God to make this concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: therefore bee thou aſſured that thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee in Chriſt, and that thou art an vndoubted heyre of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the Lord doth offer vnto vs his gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:23802:114"/>of life and ſaluation, ſo doe we receiue them by faith; but the Lord doth not only generally in the word offer theſe his gratious promiſes to all that will receiue them, but alſo particularly in the right vſe of the Sacraments to euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full receiuer: for in the Sacraments wee muſt conſider a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and correſpondencie betweene the outward ſignes and things ſignified: as therfore the Miniſter doth offer and giue, and I receiue and eate the outward ſignes of bread and wine; ſo am I as certainly to beleeue that God doth offer and giue, and that I doe receiue and feede vpon Chriſt Ieſus and all his benefits, with the hand and mouth of faith, vnto the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my particular ſoule to euerlaſting life, as my bodie is nouriſhed with theſe outward elements of bread and wine.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Apoſtle ſaith, that through faith wee <hi>haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance vnto God with boldneſſe and confidence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 3.12.</note> and therefore by faith the beleeuer is particularly perſwaded of the remiſſion of his ſinnes and of his reconciliation with God: for with what boldneſſe or confidence can the poore ſinner come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, who is terrified with the threatnings of the Law, with the temptations of Sathan, and with the confideration of his owne vnworthineſſe and ſelfe-guiltineſſe; if hee bee not particularly aſſured that his curſe is borne by Chriſt, that hee is forgiuen the whole debt of his ſins, and reconciled vnto God? What aſſured comfort can hee receiue, if hee beleeue that God hath elected <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and all his Church, if hee be not alſo aſſured that he is in this number? If a whole Citie ſhould rebel and commit high treaſon againſt a Prince, and the Prince ſhould ſend out a proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, declaring that vpon ſome conditions he would receiue them to mercie; with what boldneſſe or confidence can any in this citie come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, if he be not aſſured that he hath perfourmed theſe conditions? But this is our caſe, wee haue rebelled againſt God, and hee hath proclaimed in his Goſpell the pardon of our ſinnes, ſo wee lay hold vpon Chriſt by a true and liuely faith, and repent vs of our ſinnes: If therefore we could not be aſſured that wee haue a liuely faith and true repentance, and conſequently that Gods mercifull promiſes belong particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly vnto vs; with what boldneſſe or confidence can we come
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:23802:114"/>before him? But the Apoſtle faith, that by faith we haue this boldneſſe and confidence, and therefore it followeth that we may be aſſured that we haue faith and repentance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may certainly be perſwaded of Gods loue and our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular election.</p>

Now if the Lord would haue vs doubt of our election and ſaluation, and if this doubting were a vertue of faith, as the Papiſts teach, then ſurely there were no vſe of the Sacraments; for the word is ſufficient to beget that generall faith which is mixt with doubting, and the Sacraments which doe further aſſure vs and applie vnto vs Gods promiſes, would be rather hurtfull than profitable, becauſe they take away doubting, which is a vertue of their faith. But we are otherwiſe inſtructed by Gods truth, namely, that the Lord would not haue vs doubt of his promiſes: and therefore he hath not onely written his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but alſo hath confirmed it by his ſeale, and hath thereby particularly applied it to the vſe and benefit of euery one who receiueth it by the hand of a liuely faith, that there may be no place left to doubting. And hence it is that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Circumciſion is called <hi>the ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> Rom. 4.11. becauſe thereby as by a ſeale <hi>Abraham</hi> was confirmed in the trueth of Gods promiſes, and aſſured that the righteouſneſſe of faith, that is, the righteouſnes of Chriſt, who was the promiſed ſeede, did belong vnto him. And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to this Sacrament is Baptiſme, wherein Chriſt and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:23802:115"/>all the gratious promiſes of life and ſaluation made in him, are particularly applied to the partie baptized; and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, that all that are baptized into Chriſt haue put on Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.27.</note> Gal. 3.27. where the Apoſtle compareth Chriſt to a garment, which by the hand of faith is put on by euery particular beleeuer. So in the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, the bread and wine is particularly deliuered vnto all the communicants, to ſignifie vnto them, that euery one who ſtretcheth foorth the hand of faith doth receiue Chriſt and all his benefits, whereby his ſoule is nouriſhed vnto euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life. Whoſoeuer therefore hath faith, he may be aſſured that he receiueth Chriſt; and whoſoeuer receiueth Chriſt, he may be aſſured of his election and ſaluation; for <hi>to as many as receiue him, to them he giueth power to be the ſonnes of God:</hi> and who are thoſe?<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.12.</note>

I anſwere, that wee are not bound to beleeue, being deſtitute of a true and a liuely faith, for this were rather fondly to preſume, than ſurely to bee perſwaded of the promiſes of the Goſpell, but wee are firſt bound to haue a true liuely and iuſtifying faith, and ſo to beleeue and applie vnto our ſelues the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Goſpell; but thoſe that liue in their ſinnes without repentance, they are altogether deſtitute of true faith, which whereſoeuer it is purifieth the heart, and worketh by loue, moouing the beleeuer to endeuour and ſtriue to mortifie his corruptions, and to riſe from the death of ſinne to newneſſe of life: and therefore well may they ſecurely preſume, but it is impoſſible that they ſhould truly beleeue, becauſe they are vtterly deſtitute of a liuely faith, and where the cauſe is not the effect cannot follow: and conſequently for their infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they are ſubiect to eternall plagues and puniſhments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe not that which they are bound to perfourme.

So that whoſoeuer liueth ſtill in his ſins with pleaſure and delight, and yet beleeueth that he is elected to ſaluation, and that he is in Gods fauour, and ſhall continuing in this ſtate be made an heire of eternall life, he is not indued with true faith, but with fond preſumption and carnall ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which maketh him to beleeue that which is falſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Gods word. Though then all men, euen carnall worldlings and reprobates are bound to beleeue, and becauſe they doe not, are ſubiect to condemnation, as committing a great and fearefull ſinne; as appeareth Ioh. 3.18. and 16.8.9. where our Sauiour ſaith, that the holy Ghoſt <hi>ſhould reproue the world of ſinne,</hi>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:23802:117"/>conſequently whatſoeuer this al-knowing true and faithfull witneſſe teſtifieth, we are vndoubtedly to beleeue as being moſt ſure and certaine.

               <p>Which wordes doe miniſter vnto euery faithfull man no ſmall conſolation, if they bee rightly waied; for firſt wee vſe to ſeale thoſe things which we would haue moſt certaine and out of all controuerſie; as when a man hath made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or couenant with another, for his better ſecuritie he doth commit it to writing, and leaſt yet there ſhould any ſcruple or doubt reſt in his minde, he doth confirme it by adding his ſeale, to put the matter out of all queſtion; ſo the Lord hath added to the written couenant of his word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath aſſured vs of our election adoption and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the outward ſeale of the ſacraments, and the inward ſeale of his ſpirit, whereby he hath ratified it, not in it ſelfe, but in our hearts, that ſo all cauſe of doubting being taken away, we might certainely be aſſured of his promiſes, that they belong vnto vs not after a generall manner as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts teach, but particularly euen as this aſſurance is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſealed by Gods ſpirit in the heart of euery true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:23802:118"/>Rom. 4.11.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> The end therefore why we are ſealed to ſaluation by Gods ſpirit, is not that we ſhould doubt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but that it might be out of all queſtion fully ratified and confirmed vnto vs: for this is ſignified by this metaphor here vſed of ſealing, as may appeare not onely by the ordinarie cuſtome amongſt vs, but alſo by the vſe thereof in former times. So when <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> would haue letters written in the Kings name, which no man might reuoke, he commaundeth that they ſhould be ſealed with the Kings ring.<note place="margin">Heſt. 8.8.

Matth. 3. 17. and 17.5. and Ioh. 1.32.</p>
               <p>So, whereas the holy Ghoſt in the faithfull is called the earneſt of our inheritance, this miniſtreth vnto euery true beleeuer no ſmall conſolation, nor doubtfull aſſurance of their ſaluation; for we know that an earneſt is giuen amongſt men to ratifie and binde a bargaine, ſo as they cannot goe from their agreement after earneſt is giuen and receiued. The word <hi>arrhabo</hi> which is here tranſlated earneſt, hath alſo other ſignifications which miniſter vnto.

Whereas therefore Gods ſpirit in the faithfull is called <hi>arrhabo,</hi> which ſignifieth an earneſt pawne and hoſtage: we are hereby aſſured that the Lord will performe his couenant betweene vs and him; that he will not miſſe a day in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of his promiſe; that howſoeuer we were enemies, yet now being reconciled by the death of his ſonne, he hath giuen vs an hoſtage to aſſure vs of eternall peace, euen his holy ſpirit. And therefore let not Sathan nor all his aſſiſtants cauſe vs to doubt of Gods couenant, wherein he hath aſſured vs of our election, adoption, and ſaluation; ſeeing he hath ſealed this couenant with his ſpirit, and hath giuen vnto vs
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:23802:118"/>this earneſt and pawne, to aſſure vs that he will performe his promiſe and bargaine.</p>

If therefore the teſtimonie of ſaluation in the mindes of the faithfull, be conceiued by the preaching of the Goſpell applied vnto them by faith, then is it moſt certainly the teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit; for the inward teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit is not different from the outward teſtimonie of the word: but if this perſwaſion be not grounded vpon Gods word, as theirs is not who perſwade themſelues that they are elected, adopted, and ſhall be ſaued, notwithſtanding that they liue in their ſinnes without repentance, making no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their waies, nor indeauoring to ſerue the Lord in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe of life; then is it not the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Gods ſpirit, but a preſumptuous phantaſie, and a ſecure and carnall imagination: for the teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit in the conſcience, is the ſame with the teſtimonie of the word, and therefore it doth not beare witneſſe nor giue any aſſurance that they are ſaued, which Gods word pronounceth to bee in the ſtate of damnation. When therefore this teſtimonie is giuen in a faithfull man and, agreeable to Gods word; it is the teſtimonie of the ſpirit which ſealeth vs in the full aſſurance of that wee beleeue: according to that Epheſians. 1.13. where the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.13.</note> that after the faithfull <hi>had receiued the word of truth, euen the Goſpell of their ſaluation, and beleeued therein, they were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the holy ſpirit of promiſe.</hi> But thoſe who make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of hearing the Goſpell preached, and when they heare it, doe not beleeue it, nor apply it to themſelues by a

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:23802:120"/>on them, their vaine perſwaſion vaniſheth away, and nothing remaineth but doubting, which in the end bringeth them to vtter deſperation.</p>
               <p>But here the tempter will take occaſion to diſcourage the weake Chriſtian, and to perſwade him that he hath not Gods ſpirit, ſeeing he doth not feele in himſelfe this firme perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods loue and his election and ſaluation.<note place="margin">The perſwaſion of the ſpirit not alwaies diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our ſenſe and feeling.</note> To which we are to anſwere, that Gods ſpirit doth throughly perſwade, although not at all times, neither in our preſent ſenſe and feeling; for immediatly after our conuerſion when wee are newly regenerate, and like new borne babes in Chriſt, the motions of the ſpirit are but weake in vs, and we are not skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in vnderſtanding this heauenly language of the ſpirit, wherewith we haue been altogether vnacquainted; but the ſpirit waxing ſtronger in vs, and we growing to a ripe age in Chriſt, doth crie in our hearts, Abba father, and teſtifieth to our ſpirits that we are the ſonnes of God; which we then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better acquainted with this heauenly ſpeech, do well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and are throughly perſwaded thereby. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the poore Chriſtian who hath receiued a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſpirit is exerciſed in the ſpirituall conflict, the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous noiſe of Sathans temptations which like Cannon-ſhot ſound in his eares, and the tumultuous outcries of his owne paſſions doe ſo diſturbe and wholie poſſeſſe him, that he can not heare the voyce of the ſpirit perſwading him that hee is the child of God; till the skirmiſh bee paſt and the noiſe of temptations ceaſed, and then againe as in former times hee heareth to his comfort the ſpirit of God perſwading him of Gods loue, and hereby hee is againe aſſured thereof. So that wee are not to iudge of the hauing of Gods ſpirit in the time of our Chriſtian infancie and ſpirituall nonage, nor yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our preſent ſenſe in the time of temptation, but when wee are come to perfect age, and when the conflict of temptations is ceaſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit perſwading vs of his loue and our election, is knowne by the manner whereby it perſwadeth vs: namely, it perſwadeth vs hereof with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments grounded vpon Gods word, and drawne not from
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:23802:121"/>any worthineſſe in our ſelues, but from Gods free grace and vnderſerued mercie, and from the righteouſneſſe and merits of Chriſt; whereas Sathan and our owne fleſh neuer vſe ſuch reaſons, but either mooue vs to a bare and vaine opinion which hath no ground at all but ſelfe-loue, which maketh men eaſily beleeue that which they deſire; or els with ſome arguments drawne from ſome outward common benefits, beſtowed indifferently vpon the good and bad; or laſtly from a phariſaicall conceit and falſe opinion of our owne worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and deſerts.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus haue I proued that thoſe who are conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto God, iuſtified,<note place="margin">The firſt means the teſtimonie of the holie Ghoſt.</note> and in ſome meaſure ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, may ordinarily attaine vnto the aſſurance of their election: Now I will ſhew the meanes and ſignes whereby wee may bee thus aſſured. The firſt and principall meanes which aſſureth vs of our election, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit which <hi>crieth in our hearts Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and witneſſeth vnto our ſpirits that we are the children of God,</hi> as it is Rom. 8.15, 16. Which teſtimonie it doth not giue by extraordinarie reuelation, but by a ſecret application of the promiſes of the Goſpell vnto vs, and by an inward co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation whereby it maketh the outward miniſterie of the word effectuall for the begetting of faith in vs, whereby as with an hand wee doe appropriate the generall promiſes of the word vnto our owne ſelues. And when the Miniſters vſe reaſons to perſwade vs of Gods loue in Chriſt, the holy ghoſt openeth our deafe cares, and inlighteneth our blinde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and powerfully inclineth our wils, ſo that we may attentiuely heare, truly vnderſtand, and bee fully aſſured of that truth which is deliuered, not only in reſpect of the whole Church, but alſo in reſpect of our ſelues particularly, ſo as we can ſay, I beleeue that theſe promiſes of God are true, and that they belong to all the faithfull, and conſequently vnto me who doe beleeue and am aſſured of them, ſeeing they are promiſed on no other condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Diuers diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between the teſtimonie of the ſpirit and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſecuritie.</note>But the tempter will obiect, that many through carnall preſumption doe perſwade themſelues, that al the promiſes of the Goſpell doe belong vnto them, and therefore we may eaſily be deceiued, not being able to diſcerne betweene the teſtimonie of the ſpirit and preſumptuous ſecuritie. I anſwer, that thoſe who are indued with Gods ſpirit, may eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the teſtimonie of the ſpirit from the carnall language
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:23802:122"/>of preſumption, as is euident by that which before I haue deliuered, and alſo may more plainly appeare by manifeſt differences, if the one bee compared with the other. For pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is a fruite of originall corruption which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth vs from our mothers wombe, till it bee beaten downe with Gods ſanctifying ſpirit; but the teſtimonie of the ſpirit is a thing ſupernaturall, which no man euer feeleth before his conuerſion vnto God, when as by the preaching of the word he is humbled vnder the burthen of ſinne, ſorrowing and grieuing for his ſinnes paſt, and deteſting them from his hart, and purpoſing to leaue and forſake them in the time to come. If therefore wee haue had alwaies this teſtimonie in our mindes that wee are in Gods fauour and elected, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer felt our conuerſion, nor diſcerned any fruites thereof; then doth this teſtimonie proceede from carnall preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and not from Gods ſpirit. Secondly, thoſe who haue the teſtimonie of the ſpirit, make conſcience of the diligent and carefull vſe of the outward meanes of ſaluation, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and reading of the word, the receiuing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and other holie duties of Gods ſeruice, becauſe they know that the inward teſtimonie of the ſpirit is not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſeuered from the outward teſtimonie of the word; and the aſſurance of Gods loue and our election is not wrought immediatly in vs by reuelation of the ſpirit, but by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word and vſe of the Sacraments, made effectuall by the inward cooperation of the holy Ghoſt. But preſumption as it ariſeth not from the vſe of theſe meanes made thus effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, but from carnall ſecuritie, ſo is it not confirmed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: for the leſſe that the preſumptuous man heareth the word and perfourmeth the duties of pietie and Gods ſeruice, the more confidently doth he boaſt of his faith and full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and therefore hee maketh no conſcience of vſing theſe meanes ordained of God; nay contrariwiſe he will not ſticke to affirme, that the hearing of the word too often is the cauſe that troubleth mens mindes and afflicteth their conſciences, moouing them to doubt of Gods mercie, which before they neuer called into queſtion: and why is this, but becauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are rouzed out of their ſleepe of ſecuritie, and haue
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:23802:122"/>their confident preſumption beaten downe. If then wee are carefull to vſe all holie meanes ordained of God to aſſure vs of our ſaluation; that aſſurance and teſtimonie which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is the teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit: otherwiſe it is nothing els but fond preſumption. Thirdly, preſumption is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, and neuer doubteth nor maketh any queſtion of his election &amp; ſaluation who thus preſumeth; but this teſtimony of the ſpirit is much aſſaulted with doubting, and oftentimes thereby ſo exceedingly weakened that wee cannot heare the voyce thereof: as wee may ſee in the example of <hi>Iob, Dauid,</hi> the father of the poſſeſſed child, the two Diſciples who iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyed to Emaus, and in all Gods children who haue not yet attained vnto fulneſſe of perſwaſion, vnto which none can come but by degrees. And therefore if wee can bragge with ſecure worldlings, and ſay with the proud Phariſie, I neuer was troubled I thanke God with any doubting of mine ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; ſaluation, as many are; but alwaies haue had a ſtrong beleefe that I am in Gods loue and ſhall vndoubtedly be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: wee may aſſure our ſelues that this is the voyce of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and not the teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit. Fourthly, preſumption is ioyned with worldlineſſe and prophaneſſe, but the teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit is neuer ſeuered from ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, or at leaſt from an earneſt deſire and holie ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of ſeruing the Lord in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe: for (as I ſaid) the teſtimonie of the ſpirit in the conſcience is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer contrarie to the teſtimonie of the ſpirit in the word, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it beare witneſſe that thoſe are in Gods loue and elected to ſaluation, which the Scriptures witneſſe to bee in Gods diſpleaſure and in the ſtate of condemnation, namely, all vnrepentant ſinners continuing in their vnrepentancie: and therefore if the aſſurance which we haue of our election and ſaluation be not ioyned with a deſire to leaue our ſinnes, and with an earneſt endeuour of ſeruing God in the duties of holines and righteouſnes, then it doth not proceed from the teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit, but from carnall ſecuritie and fond preſumption. Laſtly, preſumption no longer perſwadeth men of Gods loue and fauour, than they enioy the outward benefits of this life; but when the Lord laieth vpon them any
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:23802:123"/>grieuous affliction, either outwardly in bodie and ſtate, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in mind; then this perſwaſion vaniſheth, and nothing remaineth but doubting, which commonly endeth in vtter deſpaire: but the teſtimonie of the ſpirit is conſtant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent; and howſoeuer wee cannot by reaſon of the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſneſſe of afflictions, and the violent noiſe of our own paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions heare the voyce thereof at ſome times, yet afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it crieth alowd in our hearts Abba father, and witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vnto our ſpirits that we are the ſonnes of God: So that the chiefe meanes whereby wee are aſſured of our election is the ſpirit of God. But ſeeing we haue it not naturally in our ſelues, how may we attaine vnto it? Surely we are to haue our recourſe vnto the Father of lights by earneſt prayer,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.17. Matth. 7.7. Luk. 11.13.</note> 
                  <hi>from whom deſcendeth euery good and perfect gift,</hi> hauing our faith grounded vpon Gods gracious promiſe, namely, that if we aske we ſhall receiue, and more eſpecially, that hee will giue his holie ſpirit to them that aske it, as it is Luk. 11.13.</p>

For howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <hi>Paul</hi> may plant and <hi>Apollos</hi> may water, but God alone giueth the encreaſe; yet Gods bleſſing ordinarily accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth his owne ordinance, making it effectuall by the inward operation of his ſpirit for thoſe ends for which he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained it. And though the word may long ſound in our eares before it pearce the heart, or beget any ſauing grace in vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Lord open our hearts and make the ſeed of his word fruitfull: yet thoſe who make conſcience of hearing the word, with diligence reuerence and attention, and pray for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Gods ſpirit, whereby it may become profitable to their ſaluation, may conſtantly expect the bleſſing of God vpon his owne ordinance, which they carefully vſe in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his will; whereas thoſe who neglect and contemne Gods word haue no ſuch aſſurance, becauſe it is the meanes and inſtrument which is ordained of God for this purpoſe, without which the ſpirit of God doth not ordinarily beget
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:23802:123"/>faith or any ſauing grace in vs. Though therefore we doe not after long hearing of the word, feele this aſſurance of Gods loue and our election, yet let vs not giue it ouer but expect Gods bleſſing vpon it, and waite his leaſure aſſuring our ſelues that in the end, hee will make this his owne ordinance effectuall for thoſe ends, for which he hath ordained it.</p>

               <p>This alſo may further be illuſtrated by a familiar ſimilitude; namely, as the ſunne ſhining vpon vs with his bright beames, doth imprint as it were in our eyes the image of his light, whereby we ſee the ſunne and the light thereof (the beames of the ſunne which are caſt vpon vs, being reflected backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the ſunne it ſelfe;) ſo the foreknowledge of God whereby he hath decreed that we ſhall be ſaued before all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie, is ſecret in it ſelfe, ſo that we cannot ſee not vnderſtand it directly, but yet whileſt God doth acknowledge vs for his elect, he doth expreſſe the image and forme of this his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in thoſe whom he hath elected, whereby we doe alſo acknowledge him our gracious God who hath elected vs; and ſo it commeth to paſſe that by the true knowledge of God, which is communicated vnto vs, whereby we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for our God and father, wee alſo know his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, whereby he knoweth and acknowledgeth vs for his ſonnes and children. For firſt God knoweth vs, and then by the light of this knowledge communicated vnto vs, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth our hearts with the true knowledge of himſelfe, as the ſunne firſt inlightneth our eyes, and by this light we ſee the ſunne it ſelfe.

Thus alſo Gods eternall election, whereby before all worlds he hath choſen vs in Chriſt, doth make an impreſſion, and ſealeth in our hearts the form or image thereof, whereby we make choyſe of the true God Iehouah, amongſt all the Gods of the nations to be our onely God, whom we will ſerue and worſhip. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we haue made this election, and dedicated our ſelues wholy to Gods worſhip and ſeruice alone, it is a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſigne of our election, whereby God hath choſen vs: fot our chooſing of God is an effect of his chooſing of vs, and an impreſſion or print wherewith by his election hee hath ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vs.</p>

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:23802:135"/>the power of God is aboue the power of man; laſtly he giueth vs not theſe admonitions to bring vs into doubting, but would hereby ſtirre vp our faith vnto the exerciſe of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, that it may not through idleneſſe faint and waxe ſtiffe and benummed, and vnable to performe theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actions, whereby this aſſurance and certaintie of our electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would bee infeebled and not ſo ſenſibly diſcerned: and therefore theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches tend not to this end that wee ſhould doubt of our election, but rather that wee ſhould be preſerued from doubting; to which, carnall ſecuritie, ſelfe confidence, negligence in the duties of holineſſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and continuance in ſinne would in the end bring vs; all which the ſpirit of God by theſe admonitions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations preuenteth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwere that theſe. and ſuch like admonitions, are not directed onely to the faithfull, who may and ought to be aſſured of their election, but in generall to the whole Church, wherein there are many hypocrites who content themſelues with a bare ſhew of godlineſſe, and many worldly men who pleaſe themſelues with carnall ſecuritie, and a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe of faith, which neuer ſo much as breatheth, and muchleſſe performeth any actions of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe: and therefore as it was neceſſarie that the faithfull ſhould be more and more confirmed with the promiſes of the Goſpell, ſo was it requiſit that hypocrits and ſecure worldlings ſhould be rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed out of their ſecuritie, with theſe and ſuch like admonitions and comminations.</p>

And becauſe by reaſon of this diuiſion which is in our ſelues, we are readie as it were to mutinie, one part of our forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readie to march cheerefully to the land of promiſe, the other to forſake the way, ſometimes on the one ſide being

Therefore that wee may keepe the ſtraight way without declining on either hand, God doth as it were hedge vs in on both ſides, to reſtraine vs from wandring; on the one ſide with ſweete pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that we may not deſpaire, but rely our ſelues on his ſtrength and aſſiſtance; on the otherſide with ſweete admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fearefull comminations, that we may not truſt too much vnto our owne power, nor preſume vpon our owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities: and by the meanes of the one, he doth as it were pricke vs forward in our iourney, keeping vs from once thinking of ſtanding ſtill, or returning againe into Aegypt; and by the other as with an hand he doth vphold vs, when we are wearie and readie to faint, hauing an eye to the crowne of glorie, and the garland of happineſſe, which is prepared for vs at the end of our courſe, and race of chriſtianitie. And as a skilfull pilot, when his ſhip is in a tempeſtuous and ſtraite ſea, in daunger to runne on the rockes or to ſinke in the ſandes, doth caſt our ancor on both ſides, or moſt careſully looke vnto the ſterne to keepe it in an euen courſe; ſo we ſailing in the tempeſtuous ſea of this miſerable world, are in daunger on the one ſide to daſh vpon the rockes of preſumptuous ſecuritie, and on the otherſide to ſinke in the ſands and to plunge into the gulfe of deſperation: and therefore the Lord doth ſtay vs from both, as it were with two ſtrong cables; the firſt is legall commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſtrict admonitions, to keepe vs from carnall ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and hypocriticall preſumption, the other is ſweete promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes whereby he keepeth vs from falling into doubting and deſperation; neither doth one of theſe hinder another, but both ſtay vs from falling into theſe extremes.</p>

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:23802:136"/>ſinne, and from growing inſolent ouer the ſpirit euen in Gods children, whereby in deede their aſſurance of ſaluation would be abated and languiſh. The truth whereof appeareth if wee examine the ſeuerall places. For firſt, whereas the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 10.12. ſaith, <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.12.</note> 
                  <hi>take heede least he fall;</hi> he doth not moue thoſe that are faithfull, to doubt of their perſeuerance, but thoſe that want true faith, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue themſelues with vaine preſumption, and with an opinion of faith in ſtead of true faith in deede: and therefore hee ſaith not ſimply, let him that ſtandeth, but let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, that is, he that doth not ſtand in deede but in his owne found opinion. Neither can it neceſſarily be proued, that this falling is to bee vnderſtood of finall falling away from God; but rather as the coherence of the text ſheweth, of falling into thoſe ſinnes which the Iſraelites fell into: and though it were, yet is it but an admonition to take away carnall ſecurity, not giuen to make vs doubt of our ſtanding, but to preſerue vs from falling.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas the wiſe man ſaith, Pro. 28.14,<note place="margin">Pron. 28.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth allwaies:</hi> he doth not vnderſtand thereby a doubtfull feare of our election, but a feare to ſinne, and a conſcionable care of auoiding thoſe things which are diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in Gods ſight; which feare is oppoſed to carnall ſecuritie and hardneſſe of heart, as appeareth in the ſame place where this is added, <hi>'But he that hardneth his heart ſhall fall into euill:</hi> as though hee ſhould ſay, that man is bleſſed which feareth the Lord, for this will worke in him a conſcionable care of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding ſinne, which is odious in the eyes of God, and of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, which being acceptable vnto God, hee will reward with eternall bleſſedneſſe; but hee that hardneth his heart and continueth in carnall ſecuritie, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth headlong into the euill of ſinne, and conſequently the euill of puniſhment, euen euerlaſting condemnation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas the Apoſtle, Rom. 11.20,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.20.</note> exhorteth, vs <hi>not to bee high minded but feare;</hi> hee doth not meane that wee ſhould doubt of our election and ſaluation, but doth hereby beate downe our ſpirituall pride, and opinion of our owne righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, whereby we are ready to inſult ouer the Iewes, as though we were choſen and preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:23802:137"/>them, for ſome excellencie or worthineſſe in our ſelues, and ſo derogate from the free grace and goodneſſe of God, whereby he hath choſen vs without any reſpect of our deſerts. And that this is the meaning of theſe words, appeareth in the eighteenth verſe, where he willeth the Gentiles not to boaſt themſelues againſt the Iewes who were the naturall branches. Neither doth the Apoſtle write this to the faithfull onely, but to the whole Church of the Gentiles, in which were many hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and carnall men, who contenting themſelues with a bare name of Chriſtians, would inſult ouer the Iewes, whom God had caſt off from being his Church and people; whom he warneth, not to be puft vp in pride, as though in this reſpect their ſtate were moſt ſecure and out of all danger; for as (ſaith he) they were caſt off for their infidelitie, euen when they were naturall branches, ſo ſhall you much more be reiected, who being wilde branches were grafted in their places (that is, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be the members of the viſible Church) if you continue in the like infidelity, contenting your ſelues with vame confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and fond preſumption, in ſtead of a liuely faith.</p>

So that the Apoſtle doth not here exhort vs to doubt of our election and ſaluation, but to a godly feare that we doe not fall into ſinne: he would not haue vs to doubt of Gods grace and free promiſes, but of our own ſtrength, by which wee are altogether vnable to ſtand if hee leaue vs to our ſelues: hee would not haue vs feare leaſt wee ſhould be reiected and damned, after we are truely conuerted vnto God, but leaſt we fall into ſinne, and neglect that duety which we owe to our heauenly father.</p>

The other is a ſonne-like feare, which is a fruite of faith, whereby we doe not feare God as an enemy or an angry iudge, but as a gracious Father, whoſe diſpleaſure we would by no meanes incurre; not that we feare his wrath and vengeance, as though it were ready to fall vpon vs, but becauſe we would not thus abuſe his mercy and goodneſſe towards vs, nor doe any thing which might cauſe him to looke vpon vs with a frowning countenance: or if we doe feare Gods iudgements, it is as they are inflicted on another ſubiect, and not as being ready to fall vpon vs: for this difference is betweene the feare of the wicked and Gods children, they like malefactors which are led out to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are filled with horror and feare when they thinke of the torments which they are to indure, but yet did neuer feare to commit ſuch crimes as deſcrued the puniſhments, and though they ſhould eſcape, yet this would be no warning for the time to come; but Gods children ſeeing the iudgements which are exerciſed vpon the wicked, doe feare, not leaſt they ſhould be inflicted vpon them preſently, but leaſt they ſhould ſo offend and deſerue the like puniſhments, firſt auoyding ſinne, that they may not receiue the wages thereof.

Firſt, they obiect that it is proud arrogancie and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall preſumption for a miſerable ſinner, without all doubting to aſſure himſelfe that he is elected and ſhall be ſaued. To which I anſwere, that if with the phariſaicall papiſts and proud iuſticiaries, we did build our aſſurance vpon our owne merits and worthineſſe, it were indeede intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arragancie and proud preſumption, not onely certainely to beleeue, but euen to doubt whether we are elected and ſhall be ſaued (for where as doubting is there is ſome hope alſo) whereas the ſcriptures peremptorily conclude, that they who <hi>looke for righteouſneſſe and ſaluation by the law, are vnder the curſe,</hi> Gal. 3.10;<note place="margin">Galat. 3.10. Rom. 3.20.</note> and that <hi>by the workes of the law ſhall no fleſh be iuſtified in Gods ſight,</hi> Rom. 3.20; and that <hi>we are iuſtified not by our deſerts,</hi> in whole or in part, <hi>but freely by Gods grace through the redemption which is in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> as it is, verſ. 24. But ſeeing we wholy diſclaime our owne righteouſneſſe, and humbly acknowledging our owne miſerie and wretchedneſſe, doe wholy rely our ſelues vpon the gracious promiſes of God, and the merits of Chriſt Ieſus, ſeeing we become nothing in our ſelues in the worke of our ſaluation that God may be all in all, ſeeing we caſt away all glorie from our ſelues, that we may wholy glorie in the Lord according to that Ierem. 9.24. <hi>Let him that glorieth,</hi>

                  <hi>glorie in this that hee vnderſtandeth and knoweth me:</hi> This is not proud arrogancie nor hereticall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, but chriſtian humilitie which giueth all glorie vnto God, leauing nothing to our ſelues but the comfort which is wrought in our hearts, by the aſſurance we haue of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. Nay the more vndoubtedly we truſt in Gods promiſes,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:23802:142"/>the greater is our humilitie; for the more wretched we are in our owne eyes, the more we ſee our imperfections, yea our nothing in Gods ſight; and hereby we are moued to goe out of our ſelues, to ſeeke for ſaluation onely in Gods free grace and Chriſts merits, and to reſt in them with full aſſurance, as being in themſelues all ſufficient without our workes and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe. On the otherſide the more we doubt of our ſaluation, in reſpect of our vnworthineſſe, the more is our pride and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie; for we would not doubt in regarde of our vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, vnleſſe we looked for ſaluation by our worthineſſe, and therefore we come ſo farre ſhort in faith and hope, as we finde our ſelues ſhort in merits; and whence can this proceede but from arrogancie and pride, which maketh men to looke for ſaluation in themſelues, and to doubt of Gods mercie and Chriſts merits, vnleſſe they finde that they haue deſerued them by their owne workes and worthineſſe? Let vs therefore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre this proud humilitie of the papiſts which maketh them doubt of Gods mercifull promiſes, and conſequently of his truth;<note place="margin">1.

To which I anſwere, that weakeneſſe of faith is not oppoſed as contrarie to certaintie, but to ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and full perſwaſion, and therefore weakeneſſe and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie may well ſtand together. Neither doe we imagine ſuch a certaintie of faith which is neuer ſhaken with doubting, nor aſſaulted with temptations; nay rather we teach that thoſe whom God indueth with moſt faith, he moſt exerciſeth in the conflict of temptations, like a wiſe captaine who ſetteth that ſouldier which is beſt armed and ſtrongeſt, to beare the brunt in the forefront of the battaile: and the diuell is moſt readie to aſſault thoſe who moſt reſiſt him, and moſt violently to ſtrike where he ſeeth the ſhield of faith held vp to defend; and therefore our Sauiour hath taught all his faithfull children to pray, leade vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill. But withall we affirme that though this weake faith be aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Sathans temptations, yet is it neuer ouercome; though it bee oppoſed with doubting yet it neuer falleth from aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and certaine perſwaſion; though it bee ſometimes ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, and the ſhining light thereof dimmed, yea though it be for a time hid and couered, yet in it owne nature it remaineth firme and ſtedfaſt; like the ſunne which alwaies ſhineth, though oftentimes by reaſon of the interpoſition of the cloudes or the earth, we cannot diſcerne the beames thereof; or like vnto the fire which being hid vnder the aſhes doth retaine his naturall heate, although we feele it not: So our faith retaineth in it ſelfe
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:23802:143"/>his certaintie and aſſurance as it were his light and heate, when as it is ſhadowed with the cloudes of doubting, and couered vnder the aſhes of Sathans temptations.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A weake faith doth as truely aſſure vs of our election as a ſtronger.</note>But it may be demaunded how a weake faith aſſaulted with Sathans temptations can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue certaine, ſeeing the ſtrongeſt 0 faith can doe no more but certainely perſwade? I anſwere, that our certaintie reſpecteth not our faith it ſelfe but the obiect thereof, namely Gods mercie and Chriſts merits: and therefore ſeeing a weake faith doth as well apply vnto vs the mercies of God &amp; merits of Chriſt as a ſtronger, therefore alſo it certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwadeth vs as well &amp; truely, though not ſo ſtrongly and fully of our election and ſaluation, as a ſtronger doth. So that when we haue the leaſt ſparke of faith, it doth illuminate our mindes, ſo as we can truely diſcerne the louing countenance of the Lord ſhining vpon vs though ſomewhat dimly, and as it were a farre of; euen as he that is pore-blind doth as certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee the ſunne, as he who is moſt ſharpe ſighted, though not ſo cleerely; and as he who is in a darke dungeon doth diſcerne the light as ſurely at a little hole, though he be compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with blacke darkeneſſe, as he who is in the open fieldes; ſo when we are as it were pore-blind, and compaſſed about with the darke miſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ignorance, yet by the dimme ſight of faith we certainely diſcerne Gods loue and fauour ſhining vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, though the more we encreaſe in knowledge and faith, the more cleerely we perceiue it, till at laſt hauing attained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fulneſſe of faith, we ſee him neere at hand and as it were face to face.</p>
               <p>True it is that our faith which is in it ſelfe weake and feeble, and compaſſed about with the darkeneſſe of ignorance, is mixt and turmoyled with much feare and doubting, by reaſon of our naturall inclination vnto diffidence and incredulitie, the manifold temptations of Sathan, and the burthen of our ſinnes lying heauie vpon our conſciences: which maketh Gods deere children to grone and complaine, yea ſometime to murmur and repine againſt God himſelfe, as though he were their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, becauſe he ſuffereth them thus to be vexed; but ſtill it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth after it hath receiued a foyle, and gathereth new ſtrength againſt all new aſſaults, vntill in the end it obtaineth full victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſo as all the faithfull may ſay with the Apoſtle 2. Cor. 4.8.

To which we may eaſily anſwere, if we know and remember that euery chriſtian is divided into two parts, the fleſh and the ſpirit, which continually fight and ſtriue the one againſt the other; and as they themſelues are thus op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſo are their qualities and fruites, for in the ſpirit is faith, loue, hope, zeale, ioy in the holy Ghoſt, and ſuch other ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying graces; in the fleſh is doubting, and infidelitie, hatred of God, preſumption and deſperation, coldneſſe, dulneſſe, yea deadneſſe in religion, feare, horror, and ſuch like corruptions, ſo as we may ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>I know that in my fleſh,</hi> that is, in my vnregenerate part <hi>dwelleth no good thing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.18.</note> Rom. 7.18. Now as there is a continuall warre betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit, ſo alſo betweene their qualities and fruites; for faith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually aſſaulted with doubting and infidelitie, loue of God with the hatred of God, hope with preſumption and deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, zeale with coldneſſe and dulnes in religion, the ioy in the holy Ghoſt with horror and feare of Gods anger, the curſe of the law and condemnation; and ſometimes the one ſometimes the other hath the vpper hand, both in the meane time retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their nature and properties, although (as we ſay) <hi>remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis gradibus,</hi> not exerciſing them in that meaſure and degree, as they doe when they haue victorie and giue the other the foyle. For example, when in ſome grieuous affliction, the hatred of God doth aſſault the loue of God in our hearts, and doth ſo foyle and wound it, that wee can ſcarce diſcerne that it breatheth or retaineth life, yet notwithſtanding the loue of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:23802:144"/>God euen at that inſtant is not turned into hatred, nor recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth any properties thereof, but ſtill retaineth his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and properties, which againe cleerely appeare and ſhew themſelues when the conflict is ended. The like may be ſaid of our hope, zeale, ioy in the holy Ghoſt, and other graces, when they are moſt foyled by the corruption of the fleſh which fight againſt them, ſo as they cannot poſſibly exerciſe their owne actions and functions, yet doe they not receiue any carnall properties, nor looſe any of their owne, but retaine ſtill their owne nature, which againe manifeſteth it ſelfe when the aſſault is ended. Euen as fire couered ouer with aſhes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth ſtill his owne nature of light and heate, though then by reaſon of the aſhes the light be not ſeene, nor the heate felt; but when the aſhes are remooued and new matter added vnto it, then it ſhineth and burneth and heateth as much as it did before: ſo when the graces of Gods ſpirit are couered (as it were) vnder the aſhes of our corruption, they are not diſcerned by their properties and effects; but when the corruptions are remooued by vertue of Gods ſpirit, and the graces nouriſhed with hearing of the word, prayer, holy conferences, and ſuch like ſpirituall exerciſes, as it were with new matter added vnto them, then doe they againe ſhine in their brightneſſe, and exerciſe their wonted ſtrength in all good duties to God and our neighbour.</p>

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:23802:145"/>the ſhaking of the tree is not of the nature thereof, for of it ſelfe it ſtandeth firme and ſteadie, but by outward accident, namely the winde blowing vpon it: ſo is not vncertaine waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and vnconſtant doubting of the nature of faith, for of it ſelfe it is firme and certaine; but it commeth by outward acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the boyſterous blaſts of infidelitie, and the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Sathan which (as it were) violently blow vpon it, which being paſt, it remaineth like the tree firme and conſtant. And as the graces of Gods ſpirit, and the fleſh and the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof doe ſtill retaine in themſelues their owne nature and properties, ſo alſo doe they moſt commonly ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their diuers fruites and effects, and that oftentimes in the conflict and time of temptation, ſo that the regenerate man may at the ſame time feele in himſelfe contrarie affections and actions; for the ſpirit acknowledging Gods goodnes mercie and truth in his promiſes, is repleniſhed with joy, being in hope to inioy them, on the otherſide the fleſh feeling preſent miſerie, and the ſharpnes of afflictions, ſorroweth and grieueth. The ſpirit apprehending and applying vnto it the ſweete pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpell, doth quietly reſt vpon them; the fleſh ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it owne corruption, and the huge waight of ſinne that preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it downe, feareth and doubteth: the ſpirit being aſſured of euerlaſting happines, triumpheth with ioy, deſiring nothing more than to be diſſolued and to be with Chriſt; the fleſh fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſelfe guiltie of ſinne, and in this reſpect ſubiect to the anger of God and condemnation, feareth and trembleth to thinke vpon death: The ſpirit conceiueth of God as of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull father in Chriſt, and in all neceſſities flyeth vnto him by heartie prayer; the fleſh conceiueth of him as of an angrie and ſeuere iudge, and therefore flyeth from him, deſiring rather to ſeeke for helpe any where elſe than of the Lord: ſo that the chriſtian by reaſon hereof, at the ſame time findeth in himſelfe oppoſition betweene action and action, affection and affection. For at the ſame inſtant, while the fleſh, hauing in it the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſinne and ſenſe of guiltineſſe, doth murmur repine and complaine vpon God, as an enemie which is readie to deſtroy vs; the ſpirit doth flie vnto God by a liuely faith, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelfe to his prouidence, will and protection, expecting ſaluation from him onely; which it could neuer doe, if it were
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:23802:145"/>not aſſured that we were in his loue and fauour. And in this the chriſtian may not vnfitly be compared to a childe, who hauing been ſharpely corrected by his father, doth auoyde his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence as though hee were his enemie; but if at the ſame time ſome ſuddaine danger affright him, before al other he runneth to his father for ſafegard and protection: ſo when our heauenly father hath ſharpely corrected vs, either with ſome outward or inward afflictions, we flee from his preſence as though he were our enemy; but when an imminent danger ouertaketh vs, and we be in perill to be ſupplanted with ſathan and his aſſiſtants, who are our enemies in deed, then the ſonne-like affection which is wrought in our hearts by Gods ſpirit, doth moue vs to runne vnto him before all other, deſiring and crauing his ayde and aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>And thus it appeareth, that though the fleſh and the ſpirit be mixt together, yet they retaine their owne natures, properties and effects; and though faith which is a grace of the ſpirit, be mingled with doubting, yet this doubting is not of the nature of faith, which in it ſelfe is certaine and aſſured, nay, it is not an infirmity of faith, as lameneſſe is an infirmity of the ioynts, and dimneſſe of the ſight, for it is not any way incident to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof: and therefore much leſſe is it a commendable vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of faith, as the Papiſts teach, but it is a fruite of vnbeleefe, which is in the part vnregenerate, and is oppoſed vnto faith, as appeareth Rom. 4.20. and conſequently,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.20.</note> though faith be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted with doubting, yet in it owne nature it may and doth remaine certaine and aſſured.</p>

But it may be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded how this certainty can be gathered out of the Scriptures. I anſwere, that if we would attaine vnto it, we muſt not ſeeke it in the law, where the promiſes of life and ſaluation are made vpon the condition of our own works and worthineſſe, which condition we can neuer performe, and therefore can neuer be aſſured of the promiſe: But out of the Goſpell, which doth not only ſhew that ſome are predeſtinated to life, and ſome reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neither doth it only ſpeake of our election, as it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Gods ſecret decree in it ſelfe, or reuealed in his word, but alſo it ſetteth out vnto vs the execution of the decree, with the cauſes, meanes, ſignes and effects of our election, and how it is accompliſhed for the bringing vs to thoſe ioyes to which God hath choſen vs. Firſt therefore it ſheweth the decree of God concerning our election. Secondly, Gods decree concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our redemption by the death and obedience of Chriſt our mediator. Thirdly, the decree of God concerning the calling of his Church by the miniſtery of the word, that they may be ingrafted into the body of Chriſt, and ſo participate with him in all his benefits to their ſaluation. Fourthly, the decree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſending of his ſpirit into the hearts of his choſen, by the inward operation whereof the word is made effectuall for the begetting of faith and repentance. Fiftly and laſtly, his decree concerning the iuſtifying and ſauing of thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent

And all theſe are ſo linked together that they can neuer poſſibly be ſeuered, ſo that he who is aſſured of one, may be aſſured of all; whoſoeuer is certaine that he hath faith and repentance, may be certaine alſo of his election, though he neuer preſumptuouſly ſearch into Gods ſecret counſaile.</p>

And thus theſe iugglers play faſt and looſe, making their faith like vnto the <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> or going fire, which interchangeably ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhineth cleerely, and ſometimes vaniſheth and leaueth behind it nothing but blacke darkneſſe. But let vs conſtantly oppoſe our ſelues againſt ſuch inconſtancie, and in no wiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſuch mutable variety in our faith, which maketh it more changeable than the Moone, which one while ſhineth with full bringhtneſſe, and in ſmall diſtance of time cannot be diſcerned; and to this end let vs know, firſt, that though in our ſelues wee be not worthy of the leaſt of Gods mercies, yet our vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes maketh vs not vncapable of the greateſt, for al Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are his free gifts, which he promiſeth and beſtoweth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect of our worthines or deſerts, of his meere grace and vndeſerued loue: and therfore as when we are moſt worthy in our own conceit, there is no reaſon why we ſhould preſume the more; ſo when wee finde our ſelues vnworthie, there is no cauſe why wee ſhould hope the leſſe, or be more weakly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Gods promiſes; for as they are not made vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our worthineſſe, ſo they are not diſanulled and made voide by our vnworthineſſe, otherwiſe no man liuing could haue aſſurance of them, ſeeing all men liuing are vnworthie of them. But the Lord hath made al his promiſes vnto vs in Chriſt, who was ſent to bee our Mediatour, to the end that wee who were altogether vnworthie in our ſelues, might be made wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie in him of all Gods mercies and benefits. And therefore whoſoeuer lay hold vpon Chriſt, with a true though a weake faith, and bring foorth the fruites thereof in repentance, they may certainly bee aſſured of their election and ſaluation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their vnworthineſſe. Secondly, wee are to know
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:23802:147"/>that our faith doth not reſpect our ſelues in our ſelues, neither are wee the obiect thereof, but Chriſt and his merits and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; whom our faith doth not behold ſtanding aloofe of (as the Papiſts dreame) but as hee is vnited vnto vs, and become our head and we his members; ſo as now we cannot look vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelues but we muſt looke vpon Chriſt, becauſe hee is in vs and we in him. And therefore when wee conſider the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſinnes we deſpaire not, becauſe now we look vpon them as they are tranſlated from vs and laid vpon Chriſt, who hath fully ſatisfied his fathers iuſtice by his alone and al-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſacrifice vpon the croſſe; when we conſider our imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we doubt not of Gods promiſes, becauſe they are coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his perfect righteouſneſſe; when we conſider our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe wee are not diſcouraged, ſeeing by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Chriſts worthineſſe wee are made worthie; when wee conſider that in our ſelues wee are ſubiect to the curſe of the law, the anger of God and eternall condemnation, wee are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe aſſured of euerlaſting life and ſaluation, becauſe we are vnited to Chriſt our head, who hath taken away our curſe and nailed it to his croſſe, borne his fathers diſpleaſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile vs vnto him, and was condemned and ſuffred death to free vs from death and condemnation, and to make vs heires of life and ſaluation. So that now we behold the huge debt of our ſinnes, as it is diſcharged and cancelled with his merits and full ſatisfaction; we behold our imperfections, but as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by his perfections; wee looke vpon our vnworthineſſe, but as it is ennobled with his worthineſſe; when we ſet before vs the curſe of the law, the anger of God and ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, wee conſider them as taken away and ſwallowed vp of Chriſts death and full obedience; becauſe now wee are vnited vnto Chriſt, and hee is become ours that wee might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his; hee hath taken vpon him our ſinnes and vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that hee might make vs partakers of his righteouſneſſe and worthineſſe.

Though it be fooliſhnes to thoſe that periſh, yet it is the power of God to thoſe whom God hath ordained to ſaluation, and God is no leſſe glorified in the one by ſhewing his mercie, than in the other by ſhewing his iuſtice. Though worldly men abuſe it to carnall ſecuritie, yet the godly are the more incited thereby to ſerue the Lord in holineſſe and newneſſe of life: for like louing children, the more they are aſſured of the loue of their heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father, and ſecured of his mercie and bountifull benefits, the more they loue him againe, the more they loue him the more zealous they are of his glorie, and the greater their zeale is, the greater is their care in making the light of their godly and Chriſtian liues to ſhine before men, that their heauenly father may bee glorified. So that it is not the fault of this precious ſeede, but the barrenneſſe of the ground which maketh it fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, or els for good wheate ſendeth tares cockle and darnell; it is not any defect or ill diſpoſition in this ſweet ſmelling flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but the venemous nature of theſe ſpiders which turne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into poyſon: and therefore the ſeed muſt be caſt vpon the earth, though there bee ſtones with the good ground which will neuer bring foorth fruite; the flowers of ſweete conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt not be pulled vp by the rootes and caſt away. For though the ſpider gathereth poyſon, yet the profitable Bee wil gather honey out of them. Secondly, when wee teach the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of election, wee doe not teach that men muſt gather it out of Gods ſecret counſaile, but from their owne ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which they may be aſſured that they are iuſtified, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and elected: and therefore whoſoeuer are not ſanctified but continue in their ſinnes without repentance, can haue no aſſurance by our doctrine that they are elected or ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; nay contrariwiſe, we teach out of Gods word, that <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer line in the fleſh ſhal die,</hi> Rom. 8.13. that they which performe <hi>the luſts thereof ſhall neuer inherit the kingdome of God,</hi> Gal. 5.19.20, 21. that none who continue in their vnrighteouſneſſe and vncleanneſſe ſhall enter into the heauenly Ieruſalem, 1.

For after that the debt of our ſinnes was diſcharged, our ranſome paid, and the handwriting of ordinances cancelled and nailed vnto the croſſe, theſe our ſpirituall enemies had no iuſt intereſt vnto vs, nor any thing to alledge why they ſhould longer hold vs in their captiuitie; but yet the ſtrong man who had taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion would not willingly loſe it, vnleſſe hee were ouercome with a greater ſtrength: and therefore our Sauiour Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bought vs of his father, and ſo become our true owner, buckled with our ſpirituall enemies, ouercame theſe principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers, triumphed gloriouſly ouer them, and freed

I anſwere that though Sathan held vs in his captiuitie, yet not in his owne right, for wee had not ſinned againſt him to whom we were not bound to performe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, nor were indebted vnto him; but wee had ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, whoſe ſeruants wee were by right of creation, and had infinitly runne into his debt, which we were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnable to pay; and therefore like a iuſt iudge he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vs to the perpetuall priſon of death, and committed vs to the cuſtodie of Sathan, as vnto a iaylor, to be kept in his bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, till we had ſatiffied for our ſinnes and diſcharged our debt: which being impoſſible to vs, our Sauiour Chriſt hauing aſſumed our nature and become our ſuretie and mediator, payed that we owed, and ſuffered that which we had deſcrued, and ſo fully ſatiſfying his fathers iuſtice, hath purchaſed our redemption; ſo as now Sathan had no more anthoritie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vs in his captiuitie, then the iaylor hath of holding him in priſon who by the iudge is releaſed, or the executioner of hanging him whom the iudge hath acquitted or pardoned. And therefore tyrannically exerciſing ſtill his iuriſdiction, our Sauiour by ſtrong hand ouercame him and all the power of hell, that ſo he might ſet vs at libertie whom his fathers iuſt ſentence had acquitted and his mercie pardoned.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing to be conſidered is the end of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, namely that we ſhould no longer ſerue ſinne and Sathan, out of whoſe bondage wee are releaſed; but become the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of Chriſt, who hath redeemed vs, ſeruing him in holines and righteouſnes all the daies of our liues; that ſo glorifying him here on earth, he may glorifie vs in heauen, and make vs partakers of thoſe euerlaſting ioyes, which by his death and bloodſhed he hath purchaſed for vs.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus haue I ſhewed what our redemption is:<note place="margin">The temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> now let vs conſider of thoſe temptations of Sathan which he ſuggeſteth into the minds of men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he laboreth to depriue them of this great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and to keepe them ſtill in his captiuitie, or to pul them back againe when they are eſcaped. And theſe are of two ſortes, the firſt leading to ſecuritie and preſumption, the other to doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſperation. For if he haue to deale with worldlie men; who were neuer truely conuerted vnto God, hee laboreth to perſwade them that they are redeemed by Chriſt, and therfore though they liue in their ſinnes, yet they ſhall bee ſaued, for Chriſt came into the world to ſaue ſinners: but when he aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the true chriſtian, who is indeede the redeemed of the Lord; then he moueth him to doubt and deſpaire, either of the ſufficiencie or of the efficacie, of the worke of our redemption wrought by Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>That he may continue the worldly man in his carnall ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and fond preſumption, he vſeth two principall reaſons; the firſt, that the redemption wrought by Chriſt is vniuerſall, and effectuall for the ſaluation of al the world; out of which he frameth this temptation. Chriſt hath ſhed his precious blood, and ſuffered death for all the world; and hath redeemed all mankinde which were loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> out of the bondage of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than death and hell; why therefore ſhouldeſt thou be ſo ſtrict in flying ſinne, with which thou art ſo much delighted? why doſt thou ſtriue againſt the ſtreame of thy corruptions? and wherefore ſhouldeſt thou take any great paines in the workes of holines and righteouſnes, which are ſo bitter and vnpleaſant to thy taſte and appetite? for Chriſt came into the world to ſaue all men, and not thoſe onely who are ſo ſtrict in their waies; he came to redeeme the whole world, &amp; gaue himſelfe as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ranſome for all men: and therefore doubtleſſe he will not loſe his labour, nor ſpill his blood in vaine; he wil not willingly let any periſh, whom he hath purchaſed at ſo high a rate, and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:23802:151"/>redeemed with ſo deare a price: he is alſo ſo powrefull that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be able to pull them out of his hand,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.28.</note> as himſelfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, Ioh. 10.28; and ſo wiſe that hee would not ſhed his blood, for thoſe whom he would not ſaue. And who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that God who is moſt iuſt, will impute thoſe ſinnes vnto thee for which Chriſt hath ſuffered, inflict death on thee for whom Chriſt died, and require that debt againe which is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die diſcharged? Or who can imagine that God, who is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhould ſhew ſuch inconſtancie as to ſend his ſonne into the world, to ſuffer death for the redemption of thoſe whom hee now will not ſaue; for if he would who could reſiſt his will or withſtand his power? And therefore if he hath redeemed all, ſurely he will ſaue all, and conſequently thee amongſt the reſt, though thou liue as thou liſt and follow the luſts of thine owne heart: for thy ſinnes and vnbeliefe cannot make his purpoſe voyde, nor annihilate the worke of thy redemption; nay the more thy ſinnes abound, the more his grace will abound alſo.</p>

Sect. </seg>2</label> For the anſwering of which temptation, we are to know,<note place="margin">The anſwere to the former temptation.</note> that vniuerſall redemption which is the ground and foundation thereof, is an idle dreame of mans braine, which cannot be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the word of God which is the touchſtone of al truth; neither hath our Sauiour Chriſt redeemed any other, than thoſe whom hee effectually calleth vnto the ſauing knowledge of their redemption, indueth with true faith and vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, iuſtifieth, ſanctifieth, and laſtly ſaueth, if we reſpect the purpoſe of God, and the will of our bleſſed Sauiour; although indeede the price he gaue for our redemption, was of ſufficient value for the ſinnes of all the world, if it were applied by a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this doctrine hath many enemies,<note place="margin">Teſtimonies of Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt vniuerſall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> it is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to propound it vnleſſe I proue it: and therefore I will ſhew firſt by teſtimonies of ſcriptures, and after by ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that our Sauiour Chriſt hath died for, and by his death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, thoſe onely whom hee indueth with true faith and vnfained repentance, and not for al the world as they imagine. Matth. 20.28. it is ſaid, that <hi>he came into the world to giue his life a ranſome for many.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 20.2 and 26.28.</note> and 26.28. that his blood <hi>was ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> And Eſa. 53.11. that Chriſt <hi>ſhould iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie many by bearing their iniquities.</hi> So that he hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:23802:152"/>his life a ranſome and ſhed his blood, and by bearing their iniquities iuſtified all, but many, that is, part of all. Luk. 2.34. <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.34.</note> that Chriſt <hi>was appointed by Gods decree, for the fall and riſing againe of many,</hi> that is for the fall of many reprobates, and the riſing againe of many who are elected, and therefore not for the redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all. So Chriſt ſaith that <hi>he layeth downe his life for his ſheepe,</hi> Ioh. 10.15. and therfore not for wolues and goates,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.15. and 15.14.</note> 
                  <hi>for his friends,</hi> Ioh. 15.14. &amp; therfore not for his wicked enemies; <hi>for vs,</hi> that is, for the companie of the faithfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, Rom. 8.32.33. and therefore not for the ſinagogue of Sathan and wicked vnbeleeuers.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.32.33. Matth. 1.21.</note> So Matth. 1.21. he is ſaid to be the Sauiour of <hi>his people,</hi> and not of aliants and ſtrangers; and to haue giuen himſelfe for <hi>his Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5.25.</note> Eph. 5.25, and not for thoſe who haue no fellowſhip in the communion of ſaints; that he <hi>ſhould die for the nation,</hi> that is as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith for al Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iewes and Gentils,<note place="margin">Ioh. 11.52. Rom. 3.22.25.26.</note> Ioh. 11.52. and therfore not for the wicked, and the children of Sathan. So that Apoſtle Rom. 3.22. ſaith that <hi>the righteouſnes of God</hi> (that is, the righteouſnes of Ieſus Chriſt imputed vnto vs by God, or the righteouſnes of Chriſt God and man) <hi>is manifeſted vpon all and vnto all that beleeue;</hi> and verſ. 23. that God hath ſet <hi>forth Chriſt to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood,</hi> and verſe 26. <hi>That he is the iuſtifier of him, which is of the faith of Ieſus.</hi> Where the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, reconciliation with God, and iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is reſtrained to the beleeuers onely. And to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.9.</note> Heb. 5.9. where Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to be the author of eternall ſaluation vnto all that obey him,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not vnto them who continue in their rebellion not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his will, nor ſubmitting themſelues to bee ruled by the ſcepter of his word.</p>
               <p>And as by theſe places it is apparant, that Chriſt and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits are reſtrained to the faithfull, ſo alſo in other places the vnbeleeuers and ſuch as continue in their wickednes, are flatly excluded from the participation of them. Ioh. 3.18. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth in him ſhall not be condemned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.18.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.9.</note> 
                  <hi>but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> So Rom. 8.9. <hi>If any man haue not the ſpirit of Chriſt, the ſame is not his;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:23802:152"/>it followeth that if he be not Chriſts, then Chriſt and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits belong not vnto him.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.8.</note> And the Apoſtle 1. Ioh. 3.8. plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmeth <hi>that he who committeth ſinne</hi> (that is, he who liueth in ſinne without repentance) <hi>is of the diuell, and that he who is borne of God</hi> (that is, regenerate by his ſpirit) <hi>ſinneth not,</hi> that is, liueth not in his ſins, neither committeth them with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of will. And <hi>Paul</hi> willeth <hi>Timothie</hi> to inſtruct his hearers,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.26.</note> that they <hi>might come to amendment out of the ſnare of the diuell;</hi> whereby it is manifeſt that thoſe in whom ſinne raineth, are not of Chriſt but of Sathan, and that notwithſtanding Chriſts death they are ſtill in the ſnare of the diuell til they come to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life; becauſe the blood of Chriſt is not effectual to free any out of their ſpirituall bondage, till it be applied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by a liuely faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>3</label> And thus it appeareth by plaine teſtimonies,<note place="margin">Reaſons to proue that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is not vniuerſall.</note> that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption wrought by Chriſt belongeth onely to the faithfull; which alſo by vertue of Chriſts death &amp; bloodſhed, haue their ſinnes and corruptions in ſome meaſure mortified; and not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wicked, who liue and die in their ſinnes without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Now I will alſo confirme this truth by ſtrong reaſons. Firſt, thoſe who were neuer knowne of Chriſt (that, is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for his) were neuer redeemed by his precious blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; neither is it probable that the father would giue his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued ſonne, and that the ſonne would giue himſelfe for the redemption of thoſe, whom in his eternall councell he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to reiect, or (as all confeſſe) whom he foreſaw ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: but our Sauiour will <hi>profeſſe to the workers of iniquitie that he neuer knew them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 7.23.</note> Matth. 7.23: and therefore he neuer gaue himſelfe for their redemption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for whomſeouer Chriſt hath offered a ſacrifice vnto his father, for them alſo he maketh interceſſion and is become their aduocate; neither is it probable that Chriſt would die for thoſe for whome he will not intreate, and that he would offer the ſacrifice of his body for thoſe for whom he would not offer the ſacrifice of his lips. Beſides it was the office of the ſame high prieſt to offer ſacrifice and to pray for the people, and conſequently of our Sauiour Chriſt,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.1.2.</note> as appeareth 1. Ioh. 2.1.2. where he is ſaid as well to be our aduocate, as the propiciatory ſacrifice for our ſinnes: and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 8.35. ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.35.</note>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:23802:153"/>that as Chriſt died for vs, ſo he maketh interceſſion for vs; but our Sauiour Chriſt flatly excludeth, from all participation of the fruite of his interceſſion, all thoſe who are of the world, that is,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.9.</note> all meere worldlings. Ioh. 17.9. <hi>I pray not for the world but for them which thou haſt giuen me;</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith, that as he perfectly ſaueth,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.25.</note> ſo alſo he maketh interceſſion for thoſe who come vnto God by him, that is, true beleeuers onely: and therefore for them alone he hath offered himſelfe, a ſacrifice vnto his father.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt hath died for thoſe alone in whom he hath attained vnto the end of his death; for whatſoeuer attaineth not his end is done in vaine, which argueth want of wiſedome, or power, in the agent and efficient, neither of which without blaſphemie can be aſcribed vnto Chriſt, who is in both infinit: but the end of Chriſts death (that is, the eternall ſaluation of thoſe for whom he died) is attained vnto onely in the elect and faithfull;<note place="margin">Mark. 16.16. Ioh. 3.36.</note> for as it is Mark. 16.16. <hi>He that ſhall beleeue, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; but he that will not beleeue, ſhall be damned.</hi> And Ioh. 3.36. <hi>He that beleeueth in the ſonne hath euerlaſting life, and he that obeyeth not the ſonne ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him:</hi> And therefore, Chriſt hath died for thoſe alone, who beleeue and bring forth the fruites of their faith in obedience, and not for the vnbeleeuers and diſobedient.</p>
               <p>Forthly, if all were redeemed by the death of Chriſt, then ſhould they alſo be ſaued: for what ſhould hinder them from ſaluation, who are redeemed, ſeeing they haue receiued the pardon and remiſſion of their ſinnes, as appeareth Epheſ. 1.7. <hi>In whom we haue redemption through his blood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 1.7. Col. 1.14.</note> 
                  <hi>euen the remiſſion of our ſinnes.</hi> Col. 1.14. And conſequently whoſoeuer are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed are iuſtified, and alſo heires of eternall bleſſednes; for <hi>bleſſed are thoſe whoſe iniquitie is forgiuen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 32.1.</note> 
                  <hi>and whoſe ſinne is couered,</hi> as it is Pſal. 32.1. Seeing alſo Chriſt who hath redeemed vs, is ſtronger than Sathan and all the power of hell, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al their ſpiritual enemies conioyned together, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not pluck thoſe whom he hath redeemed out of his hand violently and againſt his will, neither can we with any probable ſhew of reaſon imagine that he would willingly loſe thoſe whom he hath redeemed with the ineſtimable price of himſelfe, neither will it ſtand with the iuſtice of God to impute the ſinnes of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:23802:153"/>any to their condemnation, for which Chriſt hath fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, nor to exact that debt againe which hee hath paid: and therefore if Chriſt had died for all, God in his iuſtice could not chuſe but ſaue all: and Chriſt might well ſay to his father, to what purpoſe haue I died if thou deſtroyeſt thoſe whom I haue ſaued? what profit is in my bloud, if thou condemneſt thoſe whom I haue redeemed?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if hee died and by his death redeemed all; then alſo he died for and redeemed the Pagans, Turkes, Atheiſts and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picures, who were out of the Church and couenant of grace; and ſo iuſtification, redemption and ſaluation ſhould be out of the Church, and be extended to thoſe whom God neuer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into his couenant; which is quite contrarie to the whole courſe of the ſcriptures, where it is ſaid, that all who are ſaued are alſo added vnto the Church, Act. 2.47. and that Chriſt <hi>hath giuen himſelfe onely for his Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 2.47. Eph. 5.25.</note> Eph. 5.25. Yea if Chriſt died for all, and by his death redeemed them, then it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow that hee had redeemed euen thoſe damned ſoules who were in hell before his comming, which is moſt abſurd to be imagined; for if they were redeemed, how did they againe fall into condemnation, ſeeing they being once become Chriſts can neuer periſh, neither is any able to pull them out of his hands, as it is Ioh. 10.28.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>4</label> But againſt this it is obiected,<note place="margin">In what ſenſe Chriſt is ſaid to haue died for all men. <hi>1. Tim. 2.6. Heb. 2.9. 1. Ioh. 2, 2.</hi>
                  </note> that in the ſcriptures Chriſt is ſaid to haue died and to haue giuen himſelfe a ranſome for all men. 1. Tim. 2.6. <hi>Who gaue himſelfe a ranſome for all men.</hi> And Heb. 2.9. he is ſaid to haue <hi>tasted death for all men;</hi> and 1. Ioh. 2.2. he is ſaid to be a reconciliation for the ſinnes of the whole world. To which I anſwere; firſt, that theſe ſpeeches are not to be vnderſtood of all and ſingular men, but of all the faithfull which are gathered out of the whole world; for the drift of the Apoſtles is to ſhew that our Sauiour Chriſt died not onely for the beleeuing Iewes, but for the Gentils alſo, of what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, nation or condition ſoeuer they were. And ſo theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſpeeches are expounded Ioh. 11.52. where our Sauiour Chriſt is ſaid to haue died, not onely for the Iewiſh nation,<note place="margin">Ioh. 11.52.</note> but that alſo he might gather together in one, the children of God which were ſcattered. So alſo hee is ſaid Reu. 5.9,<note place="margin">Reuel. 5.9.</note> to <hi>haue redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs</hi> (that is all the faithfull) <hi>vnto God by his bloud, out of euery
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:23802:154"/>Sathans temptations grounded vpon the doctrine of &amp;c. kinred, tongue, people and nation:</hi> and Galat. 3.26. that <hi>all are the ſonnes of God by faith in Christ Ieſus;</hi> and verſ. 28.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.26.28.</note> 
                  <hi>That there is neither Iew nor Grecian, bond, nor free, male nor female, but all are one in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> So that theſe places are not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of all and ſingular men, but of al beleeuers, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or condition ſoeuer they be. For all the promiſes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits promiſed in the Goſpel, which is the couenant of grace, are to be reſtrained to the condition of the couenant, be they neuer ſo generall and vniuerſall; and this condition is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expreſſed and ſometimes vnderſtood, but neuer exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. So Ioh. 3.16.<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>So God loued the world, that he hath giuen his onely begotten ſonne, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but haue life euerlaſting.</hi> Rom. 3.22. it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.22.</note> that <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God by faith in Ieſus Chriſt, is giuen to all that beleeue.</hi> So Gal. 3.22.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.22.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſcripture hath concluded all vnder ſin, that the promiſe by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt ſhould, be giuen to them that beleeue.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 10.43.</note> As alſo Act. 10.43.</p>
               <p>Secondly I anſwere, that Chriſt in ſome ſenſe may be truly ſaid to haue died for all the world, namely in reſpect of the ſufficiencie of his death, though not in reſpect of the efficacie; for by his death hee paid a ſufficient price for the ſinnes of all the world, and a full ranſome for all mankinde, if all would or could applie his merits and obedience vnto themſelues by a liuely faith; but in reſpect of Gods counſaile, Chriſts wil, and the euent, his death was not effectuall for the redemption of all, but the faithful only. Euen as a ſoueraigne ſalue, may haue ſufficient vertue in it ſelfe to cure innumerable wounds and ſores, but yet it is effectuall for the healing of thoſe onely to which it is applied; ſo the precious baulme of Chriſts bloud, is of ſufficient vertue to heale the wounds of all ſinners whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but notwithſtanding it is effectuall to thoſe only, to whom it is applied by a true and liuely faith.</p>

                  </note> that hee died for all without exception. I anſwere, that it is an vſuall thing in Gods word, to put this word (all) for many, or for all thoſe which are of one kinde. So it is ſaid Mar. 1.5. that <hi>all the countrey of Iudea and they of Ieruſalem, went out vnto Iohn the Baptiſt and were baptized of him;</hi> that is, not euery man without exception, but great multitudes. So it is ſaid Mat. 4.23.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:23802:154"/>that our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt healed euery diſeaſe and ſickneſſe amongst the people,</hi> that is, many that were diſeaſed,<note place="margin">Matth. 4.23.</note> or diſeaſes of all kindes. And Act. 10.38. it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Act. 10.38.</note> that <hi>Chriſt healed all that were oppreſſed by the diuell,</hi> that is, very many, for otherwiſe great numbers oppreſſed of the diuell neuer came into our Sauiours preſence. Thus alſo it is ſaid ver. 12. that there was in the ſheete which <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw in his viſion (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>all fourefooted beaſts,</hi> that is, beaſts of all kinds. And thus ſomtimes, by all, we are to vnderſtand all the elect and them onely, and ſometimes all the reprobate and them alone. In the firſt ſenſe are theſe places to bee vnderſtood. Ioh. 12.32. our Sauiour ſaith, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he <hi>is crucified he will draw all men vnto him,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Ioh. 12.32.</note> all the faithfull and elect, for they only are conuerted vnto God and drawne vnto Chriſt. So it is ſaid Eſa. 54.13. <hi>that al ſhall be taught of God.</hi> And Iere. 31.34.<note place="margin">Eſa. 54.13. Iere. 31.34. Ioel. 2.28.</note> that <hi>all ſhall know him from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> And Ioel 2.28. the Lord ſaith, that in <hi>the latter times he will powre out his ſpirit vpon all fleſh;</hi> which places cannot be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the reprobates and wicked, but of all Gods elect and faithfull. Sometimes alſo we are hereby to vnderſtand all the reprobate and wicked. So Phil. 2.21. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that all ſeeke their owne, and not that which is Ieſus Chriſts,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.21.</note> all worldlings and wicked men. And Ioh. 3.32. the Baptiſt ſaith, <hi>that no man hath receiued Christs testimonie,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.32.</note> none of the wicked and reprobate, for all the faithfull and elect receiue it and beleeue. By all which places it is euident that this word (all) ſometime ſignifieth many, and ſometime all of one kind; and therefore in thoſe places where it is ſaid that Chriſt hath died for al men, we may vnderſtand it of many, as it is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Matth. 26.28. or of all the faithfull,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.28.</note> as in many places it is reſtrained.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is obiected that Chriſt died euen for the wicked and damned; for it is ſaid that ſome ſhall denie the Lord who hath bought them,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.1. chap. 1.2.9.</note> 2. Pet. 2.1. that ſome who are purged after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards become blind and forgetfull, 2. Pet. 1.9. that he may be deſtroyed for whom Chriſt died, Rom. 14.15.<note place="margin">Rom. 14.15. Heb. 10.29.</note> that they who are ſanctified may count the bloud of the Teſtament an vnholie thing and tread it vnder their feete, Heb. 10.29. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that theſe and ſuch like places are to be vnderſtood of men, not as they are in truth and in Gods ſight, but as they are
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:23802:155"/>in outward ſhew, profeſſion, and in the eſtimation of men, who according to the rule of charitie iudge the beſt, when they ſee not euident reaſon to the contrarie; or it may bee vnderſtood of hypocrites as they are in their owne opinion, or according to their vaine boaſting; and ſo thoſe that are in ſhew, or in their owne opinion redeemed by Chriſts death, may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates and condemned, but not any who are redeemed in truth. Secondly, thoſe hypocrites that are in the outward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church are ſaid to be redeemed, in reſpect that they are numbred for a time amongſt the faithfull, till they bewray their hypocriſie, and depart from the communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which they haue outwardly with the Saints, though they are not in truth redeemed, vnleſſe they be of the Church and members of Chriſts bodie.</p>

                  <note place="margin">That al are not redeemed by Chriſt, who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. <hi>1. Cor. 15.22.</hi>
                  </note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh 1. Cor. 15.22. but all died in <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore all are made aliue in Chriſt. I anſwere, that the Apoſtle here vnderſtandeth all the faithfull, of whoſe reſurrection he here diſputeth; and it is as much as if he had ſaid, as al the faithfull died in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo al ſhall be made aliue in Chriſt: or though it bee vnderſtood of all, that they died in <hi>Adam,</hi> yet it prooueth not that all are redeemed by Chriſt, for then the ſenſe is thus much; as <hi>Adam</hi> deriued death vnto all his, by natural propagation, ſo Chriſt hath deriued life to all his by grace: and this appeareth in the verſe following, where hee ſaith, that firſt Chriſt roſe, and afterwards they that are of Chriſt ſhall riſe at his comming: now they onely are Chriſts who are led by his ſpirit, and therefore they who haue not their part in the firſt reſurrection, whereby being ſanctified they riſe againe, from the death of ſinne to newneſſe of life, ſhall not haue their part of the ſecond reſurrection, whereby they riſe to inherite thoſe ioyes which Chriſt hath purchaſed for them.</p>
               <p>But it may bee further vrged, that if all doe not liue in Chriſt who died in <hi>Adam, Adams</hi> ſinne ſhall bee of more force than Chriſts death and ſatisfaction, and <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall be more ſtrong to deſtroy than Chriſt to ſaue. I anſwere, that their power and ſtrength is not to bee meaſured by the number of thoſe who are deſtroyed and ſaued; but according to the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:23802:155"/>they were deſtroyed and ſaued, or according to the vertue and force required to ſauing and deſtroying; for it is far more eaſie to hurt many than to helpe a few, to kil a multitude than to reſtore one to life; for euen bruite beaſts can kill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, but neither man, angel, nor other creature can giue life ſaue God alone; and ſo it was no hard matter for <hi>Adam</hi> to plunge al mankind into the gulfe of perdition, but to ſaue and deliuer vs out of this wretched eſtate, neither he nor any other could perfourme ſaue Chriſt alone: and therefore though our Sauiour had freed and reſtored to life but only one, and <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſinne deſtroyed all, yet Chriſts death was ſtronger and of more vertue in ſauing, than <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne in deſtroying. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly I anſwere, that Chriſts death is as ſufficient for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of all the world, as <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne for their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in reſpect of the infinite value and price thereof; if, as <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne was deriued vnto all by naturall propagation, ſo Chriſts death and merits were applied vnto them by faith; for there is no want of vertue in this precious ſalue to heale, but the cauſe why it healeth not, is becauſe it is reiected and caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way through incredulitie. Thirdly, Chriſts death is of far more vertue and force than <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, in that it bringeth vnto vs farre better things than we loſt in <hi>Adam;</hi> for we loſt by <hi>Adam</hi> but earthly benefits, but wee haue deriued vnto vs by Chriſt heauenly glorie and euerlaſting happineſſe; <hi>Adam</hi> caſt vs out of the poſſeſſion of the earthly paradize, but Chriſt giues vs poſſeſſion of the heauenly Ieruſalem; <hi>Adam</hi> made vs of the ſeruants of God the bondſlaues of Sathan, but Chriſt made vs of the bondſlaues of Sathan, the ſonnes of God and heires of his kingdome.</p>

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:23802:158"/>firſt Chriſt redeemed vs by paying the price of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thus he is ſaid in the Scriptures to haue redeemed vs with his blood. Secondly, he redeemeth vs when as he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this benefit of our redemption vnto vs in particular, and doth thereby free and deliuer vs from the diuell ſin and death, ſo as we are no longer in their bondage ſubiect to their power and gouernment, although we be continually aſſaulted and often foyled by them; thirdly, he redeemeth vs when as he perfectly freeth vs, not onely from the power and gouernment, but alſo from the aſſaults and moleſtations of all our ſpirituall enemies, and giueth vs eternall peace in his kingdome. The firſt was wrought immediatly by himſelfe, when as he paied a ſufficient price for our redemption, and thereby fully ſatiſfied his fathers iuſtice; the ſecond he worketh by his owne ſpirit, whereby he doth diſpell out of our minds and hearts the darke miſts of ignorance and infidelitie, and by the glorious light thereof doth illuminate our vnderſtandings, with the beames of true knowledge and a liuely faith, ſo that we know acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and beleeue that Chriſt is our ſauiour and redeemer, and are aſſured that he hath freed vs from the bondage of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemies: after which aſſurance hee begetteth in vs an earneſt deſire, of beeing more and more freed from them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and an holy indeauour of withſtanding all their aſſaults and temptations, whereby they labour againe to bring vs into their captiuitie, and withall enableth vs with ſome meaſure of ſtrength, to withſtand and ouercome them; and reneweth and confirmeth this ſtrength receiued, when in the conflict of temptation we are weakned, and haue receiued the foyle, that we may riſe vp againe and afreſh maintaine the fight. Laſtly, our Sauiour Chriſt redeemeth vs, when as he perfectly freeth and deliuereth vs from our ſpirituall enemies at his ſecond comming, when as we ſhall not onely not be ouercome nor foyled of them, but alſo not ſo much as once aſſaulted. And of this redemption our Sauiour ſpeaketh Luk. 21.28.<note place="margin">Luk. 21.28.</note>

Firſt therefore he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth that it is a thing vnreaſonable, and vtterly repugnant to Gods iuſtice, that Chriſt who was innocent ſhould be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:23802:160"/>for vs who are guiltie, that we ſhould deſerue the blame, and he ſuffereth the ſtripes, that the righteous ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and the wicked acquitted, that wee who like <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabas</hi> were cruell murtherers and wicked ſinners ſhould be let loſe, and the immaculate lambe of God in whom there was no fault ſhould be deliuered vp to be crucified; for what were this but to make the iuſt God like vniuſt <hi>Pilate?</hi> what were this but to deny his owne word, hauing ſaid that the righteous ſhould liue in his righteouſnes,<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.20.</note> and the ſinner die in his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? To which I anſwere, firſt, that it would not indeede haue ſtoode with Gods iuſtice, to haue puniſhed Chriſt as he was innocent and righteous, nor to haue acquitted and abſolued vs who were vnrighteous and wicked; but he puniſhed Chriſt in reſpect that he had taken vpon him the ſins of all the faithfull, and abſolueth vs as we are freed from our ſins, &amp; clothed with his righteouſnes and obedience. He puniſhed Chriſt, not as he was moſt iuſt and free from ſin, but as he was our ſuretie who had taken vpon him to diſcharge our debt, and to ſatiffie for our ſinnes; and thus the creditor may iuſtly require his debt of the ſuretie though in reſpect of himſelfe he owed him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and thus he may, nay ought to releaſe the principall, when the ſuretie hath allreadie diſcharged the debt. Secondly I anſwere that it had bin iniuſtice in God, if he had forced our Sauiour Chriſt, who was iuſt and innocent, to vndergoe the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments which were due vnto vs, who were malefactors and offenders; for this were to condemne the righteous, and to iuſtifie the wicked: but our Sauiour Chriſt of his owne free accord, did voluntarily offer himſelfe to ſtand in our place, and to diſcharge that debt which we owed, and to make ſatiſſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his father, by ſuffering that puniſhment which wee had deſerued.<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.18.</note> And this apeareth, Ioh. 10.18. where our Sauiour ſaith, that <hi>no man tooke his life from him, but that hee laied it downe of himſelfe.</hi> And the Apoſtle telleth vs that <hi>he humbled himſelfe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.8.</note> 
                  <hi>and became obedient vnto death,</hi> Phil. 2.8. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, his death is called a ſacrifice or free oblation, which he voluntarily offered vnto his father, Heb. 9.14:<note place="margin">Heb. 9.14.</note> and therefore the Lord might iuſtly take that which Chriſt freely gaue, nay it had been crueltie and iniuſtice if he ſhould haue refuſed, the paiment of ſuch a ſufficient ſuretie, when he voluntarily offered
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:23802:160"/>it for our diſcharge, chooſing rather ſtill to haue kept vs in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, bound in the chaines of euerlaſting death. Laſtly, there might haue been ſome ſhew of rigor and iniuſtice, if Chriſt the innocent had been ouerwhelmed, in ſuffering the puniſhments which were due vnto vs, who were the offendors; but being not onely man which ſuffered but God alſo, and therefore of infinit power and maieſtie, he was able to pay our great debt, and yet is neuer the poorer; to ſuffer death and ouercome it by ſuffering: and by yeelding a while to the malice of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemies, he finally vanquiſhed and gloriouſly triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ouer them all; and therefore it was not iniuſtice in God to ſuffer our Sauiour Chriſt, to vndergoe that which he was ſure to ouercome; but vnſpeakable mercie towards vs, in ſending his ſonne to pay that debt which we could neuer haue diſcharged, and to ſuffer puniſhments for a time, which otherwiſe wee ſhould haue endured for euer.</p>
               <p>By this then it appeareth, that God might iuſtly receiue the price of our redemption, which Chriſt freely offered. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the lawes of redemption there is required, not onely that the redeemer pay a price or ranſome, but alſo that he haue right to that which he doth redeeme, it may be demaunded what right our Sauiour had ouer vs, that hee ſhould pay this price for vs. I anſwere, that as our Sauiour Chriſt conſiſteth of two natures, ſo alſo he had a twofold right vnto vs; for as he was God, he had the right of proprietie, &amp; was our true owner; he was our Lord and therefore had right to redeeme his owne ſeruants; he was our King, and therefore had right to redeeme vs who were his ſubiects; yea he was our creator, and therefore he had more right then any Lord or King to redeeme vs who were his creaturs; as he was a man he was our kinſeman, fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bone; yea he was our brother, as it is Heb. 2.11.12. and Ioh. 20.17;<note place="margin">Heb. 2.11 12.

I anſwere, that Chriſt who ſuffered for vs, was not man only but God alſo; in which reſpect it is ſaid, that God purchaſed his Church with his blood; not that God hath blood, but becauſe he that ſhed his blood, was not onely man but alſo God; and therefore his ſhort ſufferings were of more worth, vertue and valew, than the euerlaſting ſuffrings of al the world; for they ſhould euer haue ſuffred, but could therby neuer haue ſatisfied, becauſe our ſins deſerued infinite puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in that we had by them offended the infinit iuſtice and maieſty of God; which becauſe finit creatures could not beare, Gods iuſtice required that they ſhould be infinit in time and euerlaſting, ſeeing they could not be infinite in meaſure; but the ſuffrings of Chriſt, though ſhort in time, yet were they infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit in valew, worth and merit, becauſe he was not man alone, but God alſo, and therfore at once he put away ſin by the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himſelf,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.26.</note> &amp; <hi>by his one oblation he took away the ſins of many,</hi> as it is Heb. 9.26, 28. As therefore: <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, which in it ſelfe was finit, as proceeding from a finit creature, notwithſtanding deſerued infinit puniſhment, becauſe God whom by his ſin he offended was infinit; ſo contrariwiſe Chriſts ſuffrings were but of ſhort continuance in reſpect of time, but yet of infinit merit and worth, becauſe he that ſuffered was not man alone, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo God, and therefore infinite.</p>

For example, if thou doſt thus conclude, ſome men are redeemed by Chriſt, but I am a man, therefore I am redeemed: thou mighteſt as wel reaſon thus, ſome men are kings, but I am a man, therefore I am a king.

For as a citie which hath once bin beſieged and not ſacked, wil euer after be more ſtrong to hold out if it be aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the like danger, becauſe the citizens will carefully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their walles and increaſe their bulwarkes; and as he who hath been once robbed by theeues, will euer after ride better prouided to make reſiſtance, that hee doe not againe fall into their hands; ſo thoſe who are beſieged and aſſaulted by their ſpirituall enemies, will euer after more carefully arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt them with the graces of Gods ſpirit, that they may not be ouercome nor foiled by them.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:23802:164"/>they reſort to skilfull Lawyers, crauing their counſaile how they may maintaine their right, and anſwere the plea which their aduerſarie makes againſt them; whereby often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it commeth to paſſe that they make their title not onely much more ſtrong in it ſelfe, but alſo more cleere and euident vnto al others, ſo that afterwards none dare once aduenture to trouble them againe, or call their right into queſtion: ſo whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt we neuer doubt of our heauenly inheritance we reſt ſecure, and let the book of God which is our beſt deed and euidence, lie vnder our cupbords till it mould for want of vſe; but when ſathan by his temptations doth call our title into queſtion, and pleades that we haue no right to Gods kingdome, then do we moſt carefully and diligently peruſe the booke of God, then doe we goe vnto Gods Miniſters, deſiring their counſaile how we may anſwere Sathans plea and cleere our title, then doe we moſt carefully vſe all good means to increaſe our knowledge, that thereby wee may throughly infourme our ſelues of our right, and confirme our aſſurance againſt all cauils and obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

So that now though we die, yet are we not ſubiect vnto death, neither ſhall wee be held vnder the dominion thereof; though wee are not wholy exempted from death, yet now the nature therof is quite altred; for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore it was vnconquerable, but now eaſily ouercome; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore it was a curſe for ſinne, but now turned into an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bleſſing, as deriuing vnto vs many benefits: for firſt it freeth vs from all our afflictions, with which in this life wee are ſo much moleſted; it deliuereth vs from the irkſome company of prophane wicked men, who grieue the very ſoules of the righteous, and make them to crie out with <hi>Dauid; Woe is me that I remaine in Meſhech, and dwell in the tents of Kedar;</hi>

And thus hath the Viper ſinne, bred a yong one which eateth out it own belly; for ſinne brought foorth death, and death deſtroyed ſinne: had it not bin for ſinne, death had neuer entred into the world, and were it not for death, ſinne would neuer go out of the world.

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:23802:165"/>as they ſhall neuer afterwards not only not preuaile, but not ſo much as aſſault or trouble vs: and thus doth euery Chriſtian, with <hi>Dauid</hi> cut off <hi>Goliahs</hi> head with his own ſword; for death was the weapon which Sathan vſed to deſtroy vs, and with this weapon we giue Sathan a finall ouerthrow. Laſtly, death which heretofore was the high way to hell and deſtruction, is now become the readie entrance into Gods kingdome, and like a foule gate whereby we enter into a faire palace; hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was a firie ſerpent which by ſtinging killed &amp; deſtroyed vs, but, now our Sauiour hath pulled out the ſting, it is become ſo harmeleſſe that we may ſafely put it into our boſoms, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiuing any hurt: and in this reſpect it may not vnfitly be compared to the braſen Serpent, which looked like other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, but in ſteed of wounding it preſently cured, in ſteede of killing it preſerued life; ſo though death retaine his former ſhape, ſo that wee are afraid and readie to flee from it, yet it is but in outward appearance; for in ſteed of an euer dying life, it giueth vs poſſeſſion of a neuer dying life and endleſſe happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Heretofore it was the diuels ſergeant to arreſt and carrie vs without baile, into the perpetual priſon of vtter darkneſſe, but now it is the Lords gentleman-vſher to conduct and place vs in the kingdome of heauen. Heretofore it was like the diuels cart wherein we were carried to execution, now it is like <hi>Elias</hi> firie chariot whereby we mount vp into heauen. And this <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth 2.

On the other ſide how hapneth it that ſome atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely heare Gods word, treaſure it vp in their memories, and thereby haue their minds inlightned with the knowledge of God, their wils inclined to holines and righteouſnes, their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſanctified, their liues reformed? ſurely becauſe the Lord doth ioyne in theſe, the inward operation of his ſpirit with the outward miniſterie of his word, making it effectuall for their true conuerſion; whereas he leaueth the other to their owne corrupt affections and hardnes of heart.</p>
               <p>And thus it appeareth that the elect onely are effectually called: as for the wicked and reprobate, though they heare the outward preaching of the word, by which they are inuited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt; yet they ſtubbornly refuſe to come vnto him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect all the gracious promiſes of the Goſpell, to their eternall perdition; becauſe the Lord leaueth them to their owne luſts and corruption, not opening their hard hearts, nor inclining their peruerſe willes nor ſanctifying their corrupt affections.</p>

                  <hi>If you were of the world, the world would loue his owne; but becauſe you are not of the world, but I haue choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith that after our calling and conuerſion,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.19.</note> we are <hi>no more ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and forreners, but citizens with the ſaints, and of the houſehold of God.</hi> Now the Lord maketh this choyſe of vs before others,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:23802:167"/>not for any reſpect of worthines or excellencie in vs more then in them, but of his meere mercie, vndeſerued grace,<note place="margin">That the Lord calleth vs, not for any reſpect of our own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines.</note> and free good will; neither doth he therefore intertaine vs into his Church and family, becauſe wee are alreadie, or becauſe hee knoweth we will bee hereafter holy and righteous; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing freely called vs without any our deſerts, he doth alſo of his owne vndeſerued loue giue vs his holy ſpirit, whereby we are purged from our corruptions, ſanctified and raiſed vp from the death of ſinne to newnes of life; ſo that our holines is not a cauſe of our calling, but Gods election and calling is a cauſe of our holines. And this appeareth both by teſtimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and examples. For the firſt, the Lord profeſſeth,<note place="margin">Eſa. 65.1.</note> Eſa. 65.1. that he offered himſelfe <hi>to thoſe that asked not after him, and was found of them that ſought him not &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle Epheſ. 2.1. affirmeth that euen thoſe who are the Church and people of God, were before their calling and conuerſion, not ſicke only, but euen <hi>dead in their ſinnes, in which they walke according to the courſe of the world;</hi>

                  <hi>that they were by nature the children of wrath as well as others,</hi> as it is verſ. 3. <hi>and that they were without Chriſt, aliants from the common-wealth of Iſraell, ſtrangers from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of promiſe, and had no hope, and were without God in the world,</hi> as it is verſ. 12. So 1. Cor. 6.11. he ſaith, that thoſe who were now ſanctified and iuſtified, were in time paſt fornicators,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.11.</note> idolators, adulterers, wantons, buggerers &amp;c. The Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> like wiſe writing to the Church of Chriſt, ſaith both of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and them alſo, that they had ſpent the time paſt before their conuerſion, after <hi>the luſt of the gentiles, walking in wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, gluttonie, and in abominable idolatries,</hi>

               <p>This alſo is plaine in the examples ſpecified in the booke of God: for, what excellencie or worthines was in <hi>Abraham</hi> who before his calling was an idolater? or in <hi>Rahab</hi> who had ſpent her time in luſt and filthines? or in <hi>Manaſſes</hi> who was a cruell idolater, a murtherer, a ſorcerer? or in <hi>Matthew</hi> who was a publicane? or in <hi>Paul</hi> who was a bloodie perſecutor? or in the

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:23802:168"/>this the Apoſtle ſpeaketh Epheſ. 4.15.16. where hee exhorteth the faithful, <hi>to grow vp into him which is the head, that is Chriſt,</hi>

Now wee muſt not conceiue of this vnion, that it is either natural,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.20.21.</note> as the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Trinitie are vnited in the ſame diuine nature, or perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall as the bodie and ſoule being vnited make one man, or corporall as the parts of a building are coupled one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but this coniunction and vnion is made by the ſpirit of God, which dwelling in the manhood of chriſt aboue meaſure, filling it with the graces thereof, is from it deriued vnto all the faithfull and true members of Chriſts bodie, filling them with the like graces in meaſure; and on our part by a true and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, whereby we doe applie vnto vs Chriſt Ieſus and all his benefits. And this appeareth Eph. 2.22. where the Apoſtle ſaith that <hi>wee are the habitation of God by the ſpirit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2.22. 1. Ioh. 4.13.</note> And 1.

               <p>And ſo much concerning the parts of our effectuall calling;
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:23802:169"/>the meanes whereby the Lord thus calleth vs,<note place="margin">Of the meanes of our effectual calling.</note> are firſt on Gods part the preaching of the word, which is made effectuall by the inward operation of his ſpirit; firſt to mollifie our hard hearts, and truly to humble vs, by ſetting before vs our ſinnes and corruptions, and this is done by the preaching of the law: and after wee ſee our inabilitie and inſufficiencie of working our owne ſaluation, we are thereby brought out of our ſelues, to ſeeke for ſaluation in Chriſt Ieſus, applying him and his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits vnto vs by a true and a liuely faith, and this is done by the preaching of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>The meanes on our part is the ſauing hearing of the word, whereby our hard hearts are mollified, and we truly humbled, and brought out of our ſelues to ſeeke for ſaluation in Chriſt, whereby alſo true faith is begot in vs, wherewith wee applie, Chriſt vnto vs, and relie vpon him alone for our ſaluation.</p>

The firſt argument to proue the ſcriptures to be written by the motion and reuelation of Gods ſpirit, is the antiquitie thereof; for whatſoeuer religion is moſt auncient, that proceedeth from God: but the religion contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſcriptures, is of all other moſt auncient: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God was the author thereof. The firſt part of this reaſon is cleere and manifeſt; for ſeeing man was created for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to the end he ſhould worſhip and ſerue him, and could not performe acceptable worſhip and ſeruice vnto God, vnleſſe he reuealed his wil vnto him; therfore, that man might attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of his creation, it was neceſſarie that the Lord ſhould from the beginning reueale vnto him his true religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might know how to worſhip and ſerue him, according to his will. And conſequently, the firſt and moſt auncient reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the true religion, which proceeded from God; and all other are falſe and counterfait, which are diſagreeing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant hereunto, ſeeing Gods will is one and the ſame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and immutable. The ſecond part of this reaſon, namely that the religion deliuered in the ſcriptures is of all others moſt auncient, is of vndoubted truth; for it is within a few daies as auncient as the world it ſelfe, taking it beginning from mans creation, and ſo continuing in a conſtant and vnchangeable courſe vnto this day. Now all other religions are but new and vpſtart in compariſon hereof, taking their beginnings diuers thouſand yeares ſince the creation; yea euen the Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues which they worſhip (which intruth were men like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues) had their beginning for the moſt part, long ſince the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as their owne hiſtories manifeſtly declare. Neither did any other religion of the heathen continue one
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:23802:174"/>and the ſame; for that which one receiued another reiected, that which one confirmed another changed, and time hath worne them all out, leauing ſcarce any ſmall remnants or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of them. And therefore all other religions, ſauing that which is deliuered in the ſcriptures, are falſe and counterfet; and this only the truth of God.</p>

For the ſubiect whereof they intreate are the great workes of the euerliuing God, how hee exerciſeth his mercie towards his children in ſuſtaining, defending, and ſauing them from all their enemies, and his iuſtice towards the wicked in turning their counſailes to fooliſhnes, in ouerthrowing their deſignes and purpoſes, curbing in their rage and violence, and in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and deſtroying them. Now if you conſider and peruſe all other writings in the world beſides, you ſhall finde no ſuch matter contained in them; for ſome labour in poliſhing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:23802:177"/>Arts; ſome ſet out large hiſtories of the actions, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes, ſucceſſe, policies, enterpriſes and perturbations of men like themſelues: ſo that at the firſt ſight wee may know that they are indited by the ſpirit of man, ſeeing they are wholie ſpent in humane affaires, neuer intermedling with any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall matter appertaining vnto God. Moreouer, the ſcriptures attribute the gouerning and wiſe diſpoſing of all things to Gods al-ruling prouidence, that he may haue the whole praiſe of his owne workes; as when they ſpeake of ſome famous vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, they doe aſcribe it neither to the wiſedome of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, nor to the valour of the common ſouldier, but vnto the Lord of hoaſts alone; neither doe they make poems in the praiſe of <hi>Moſes, Ioſua, Dauid, Ezechias,</hi> or any other of the Kings and Leaders, but in the praiſe of the Lord, who by his owne ſtrong arme hath giuen his children victorie ouer their enemies. Now whence can this proceed but from the ſpirit of God inditing them, who contrarie to the nature of man which deſireth rather all praiſe himſelfe, doth moue him to refuſe all glorie attributed to himſelfe, that all the praiſe may bee aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto God? So when they ſpeake of any benefit receiued by the Church, they doe not attribute it to worldly friends, their good fortune, or their owne induſtrie and labour, but to the bleſſing of God proceeding of his meere mercie &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards them. And contrariwiſe, when they ſet downe the deſtruction of the wicked, they doe not aſcribe it to any want of their owne care and prouidence, nor to the malice or power of their enemies, nor to blind chance, or other outward accident, but to the hand of God exerciſing his iudgements vpon them, and puniſhing them for their ſinnes. Now if you peruſe all other writings, you ſhall finde that they aime at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe than Gods glorie; for ſome write to ſhew their elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, others to extoll their wits and deepe learning, others to aduance the praiſe of mortall men aboue the clowdes, ſome for one end, and ſome for another, all aiming at their owne praiſe, pleaſure or profit, neuer ſo much as once reſpecting Gods glorie in their leaſt thought; and hence it is that ſetting downe any victorie they aſcribe it to the weakneſſe or want of wit, prouidence or courage of the aduerſe part, or to the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Captains, the reſoluteneſſe of the ſouldiers, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages

So likewiſe when they ſpeake of any other affaires or accidents which fall out in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, they aſcribe all to outward circumſtances, inferiour meanes and ſubordinate cauſes, as though God had giuen ouer the gouernment of the earth, and had committed the ruling of the ſterne to blind fortune.

To which I anſwere, that it doth not become a

Secondly, the Scriptures were penned by the holy Ghoſt, not onely for the wiſe and learned, but alſo for the ſimple and ignorant: and therefore howſoeuer the Lord in the profunditie of his wiſedome, could haue written in ſuch a loftie ſtile as would haue filled euen the moſt learned with admiration, yet hee vſeth a ſimple eaſie ſtile fit for the capacitie of all, becauſe it was for the vſe of all, and neceſſarie to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be vnderſtood of all ſorts and conditions. As therefore he frameth himſelfe to our ſhallow capacitie in the penning of the Scriptures, and ſpeaketh not according to his vnſearchable wiſedome, but after the manner of men, or els no man, no not the moſt wiſe and learned could vnderſtand him: ſo he thought it fit to ſpeake aſwell to the capacitie of the ſimple as the wiſe, becauſe the knowledge of his word was no leſſe neceſſarie to ſaluation to theſe than to the other; and in his mercie and goodneſſe hee vouchſafed as well milke to the babe, as ſtrong meate to thoſe who were come to more ripe yeeres in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſpirituall wiſedome. At which the wiſe and learned haue no reaſon to be offended, ſeeing the ſaluation of one is as deare to God as of another, and they may with greater facility vnderſtand the Scriptures being plaine and eaſie, which could not be vnderſtood of the ſimple, if they were penned in a lofty eloquent phraſe. And yet if they examine the Scriptures in the balance of a true iudgement, they may finde food therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained fit for their owne pallat and taſte; for vnder this humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie they ſhall diſcerne more maieſtie, vnder this ſimplicitie more deepe wiſedome, vnder this vnpoliſhed plainneſſe more powerful perſwaſions to work vpon and incline the affections, than in all humane writings whatſoeuer.

And what needs the truth of God, which in it ſelfe ſhineth cleerely like the Sunne in his chiefeſt brightnes, the goodly ornaments of humane eloquence which would but darken the beames thereof? Or what needes that which is heauenly and diuine, any helpe from that which is earthly and carnall to commend it to mans iudgement? No, no, the flowers of Rhetoricke and helpe of wittie Sophiſtrie, is more fit for <hi>Tullies</hi> orations, whereby oft times a good cauſe is made bad, and a bad one good, right wrong, and wrong right, than for Gods diuine truth, which like the Sunne ſhineth moſt gloriouſly when it is bare &amp; naked. Laſtly, it is to be obſerued that the Lord in his wiſedome doth manifeſt his power in weakneſſe, his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie in baſenes; and his wiſedome in fooliſhnes, to the end that weaknes baſenes, and follie, may ſerue as foiles to make his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, maieſtie, and wiſedom appeare to vs more glorious, though in truth in themſelues they are infinite, and nothing can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their excellencie. But becauſe wee lie groueling on the earth, and are readie to aſcribe al to the inferiour means, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnto God: therefore the Lord chuſeth weake and ſimple meanes, that his own power and wiſedome may be in them more manifeſt. For example, if the Lord had penned the Scriptures in ſuch an eloquent ſtile as would haue rauiſhed the readers with delight, we would like fooles haue ſtood admiring at the curious worke of the casket, and neuer opened it to looke vpon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious iewel therin contained; &amp; haue bin ſo much affected with the words, that in the meane time we would haue neglected the matter; but when this treaſure is brought vnto vs but in an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then veſſell, when this beautifull feature is cloathed in meane at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and the diuine wiſedome of God ſet foorth in an humble and ſimple ſtile, wee leaue ſhadowes and behold the ſubſtance, neither doe we reſt in the outward letter, but ſearch after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward truth. So alſo if the Lord had in the penning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vſed inticing eloquence, or affected humane learning, men would haue been readie to haue ſaid, that by the force thereof ſo many were drawne or inticed, to embrace religion and to ſpend
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:23802:180"/>their liues in Gods ſeruice; but when as in outward ſhew there is nothing but vnpoliſhed plainneſſe and ſimple rudeneſſe, by which neuertheleſſe the hearers vnderſtanding is more inlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, his wil more powerfully inclined, his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruled, than by all the eloquent perſwaſions which wit and learning can inuent, they are driuen to confeſſe that the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is hidden vnder this ſimplicitie, his power vnder this outward weaknes, and that the Scriptures haue their vertue and force, not from the inticing ſpeech of mans wiſedome and excellencie of words, but from the power and plaine euidence of Gods ſpirit, who was the author and inditer of them.</p>

For example, though all men know by the light of nature that there is a God, ſeeing this truth is written in large characters in the faire volume of the creatures, ſo as none can behold them but he muſt needes know and acknowledge it; yet that this God being one in nature ſhould be diſtinguiſhed into three perſons, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, without any diuiſion of ſubſtance or confuſion of perſons, mans reaſon cannot conceiue, though the Lord hath reuealed it, and much leſſe could inuent it ſeeing now it cannot comprehend it. So, that the world and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures therein contained were created, the light of nature ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently teacheth vs, ſeeing they haue an end and therefore had a beginning, a time of corruption and therefore a time of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo, and as is the nature of euery ſeuerall part, ſo is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the whole vniuerſall; ſeeing alſo one effect brings vs to his cauſe, and that cauſe to a ſuperiour cauſe, and that to another vntill we come to the higheſt and ſupreame cauſe which is God, who hauing his being of himſelfe giueth being to all things: but that all this goodly order ſhould bee brought out of confuſion, this light out of darknes, that al theſe excellent creatures ſhould be created of nothing, by the alone word of their omnipotent Creator, it paſſeth the conceit of humane reaſon, &amp; therefore his inuention alſo. So, that we are wretched and full of miſerie, not only our reaſon but euen our ſenſes can teach vs; but how wee
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:23802:180"/>ſhould be freed out of this miſerie and attaine vnto euerlaſting happineſſe, is a thing aboue the reach of mans wiſedome. And that we are vnable to performe thoſe duties we ought, and leaue thoſe ſinnes vndone which we ſhould omit, and by both offend God, the law of nature written in our hearts, and the checks and feares which euery one feele in their owne conſciences doe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently teach vs: but the meanes whereby wee ſhould be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vnto God whom we haue offended, as they are ſet down in his word, namely, that the ſecond perſon in Trinitie ſhould take vpon him mans nature and be borne of a pure virgin, that in this nature hee ſhould for vs perfourme perfect obedience to Gods law, and ſuffer affliction, miſerie, yea death it ſelfe to reconcile vs to his Father and procure his loue, to free vs from euerlaſting death and damnation, and to purchaſe for vs euerlaſting life and happineſſe, and that his obedience and merits ſhould become ours, by reaſon of that vnion whereby hee becommeth our head and wee his members, which vnion is made principally by his ſpirit, and inſtrumentally by faith, doe all ſeeme ſtrange, yea ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to humane reaſon; and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, that the <hi>natural man perceiueth not the things which are of the ſpirit of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.14.</note> 
                  <hi>for they are fooliſhnes vnto him, neither can hee know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned;</hi> as it is 1. Cor. 2.14. And if he cannot know and conceiue them when in the preaching of the Goſpell they are reuealed vnto him; how much leſſe could hee inuent them hauing neuer heard of them? or who can imagine that in policie he would haue deuiſed ſuch a religion to keep the world in awe and obedience, as to euery worldly man ſeemeth fooliſh and abſurd, yea contrary to his nature? For what can be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the haire, than to deny our ſelues and to take vp our croſſe and follow Chriſt? than to reiect our owne workes and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to ſeek for iuſtification in Chriſts death and obedience alone? than to imagine that manifold afflictions and great miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, is the high way that leadeth to glorie and endleſſe felicitie? and that pleaſures, honours, and riches, make vs vnfit to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods kingdome? And therefore ſeeing the doctrine of the Scriptures are not onely aboue the reach of humane reaſon, but alſo flat contrary to naturall wiſedome, it plainly prooueth that they are not the inuention of mortall man (for then the effect would bee like the cauſe) but the word of the euerliuing God,

The like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections alſo he maketh againſt the reſt of the Scriptures, as that either there was not any ſuch <hi>Moſes,</hi> or if he were, that he was but ſome cunning fellow who writ of miracles and wonders ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer done, to gaine credit to his law which he had publiſhed; or if he wrote nothing but truth in his time, yet we know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe books which goe vnder his name are perfect as he left them, or depraued and corrupted, hauing many things altred, added, &amp; detracted, according to the pleaſure of thoſe who haue had the keeping of them. And ſo alſo hee obiecteth againſt the other parts of holy Scriptures. To this I anſwere, that as it were great abſurditie to call in queſtion the writings of <hi>Cicero, Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Plutarch</hi> and other Heathen men whether they were penned by any ſuch men or no, becauſe the next age receiued them from the authors themſelues, and deliuered them to the next inſuing, and ſo by tradition from hand to hand they are come vnto vs; ſo it is no leſſe abſurditie to call into queſtion whether the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were written by the Prophets and Apoſtles who liued in their ſeuerall times, ſeeing the Church hath receiued them from time to time, and deliuered them to their ſucceſſors to this day. Moreouer, the law publiſhed by <hi>Moſes</hi> was not in ſecret or in a corner before ſome few witneſſes, but in the preſence of ſixe hundred thouſand men, beſides women and children, and the ſtrange miracles and workes of God full of wonder, which hee wrought for the better confirmation of his law giuen, were done and perfourmed in the preſence of many thouſands, who made relation of them to their poſteritie, and they to theirs to this day. Neither was it eaſie to be corrupted, altred or changed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lawgiuer did ſtraightly charge all men that they ſhould not adde, detract, or alter any thing vpon paine of preſent death in this world, and euerlaſting death in the life to come; who therefore would incurre the danger of ſuch fearfull puniſhment for the ſatisfying of his fruitleſſe phantaſie? Moreouer, this book of the law was ſafely kept in the Tabernacle, and after in the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:23802:182"/>Temple in the Arke which was placed in the holy of holieſt, and diuers authenticall copies written out of it for euery one of the twelue tribes, which were euery Sabbaoth day read and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in their Sinagogues; yea ſo familiar were theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings with the Iewes, that they were written in their houſes, and vpon their garments, ſo as it was not poſſible for any man to falſifie them but it would preſently bee eſpied. Yea (will the tempter ſay) but though they could not be depraued or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet they might at firſt bee inuented by ſome more ſubtill than the reſt, and ſo thruſt vpon men vnder the authority of God himſelfe, as being the writings of his Prophets and Apoſtles. To which I anſwere, that there is no probabilitie of truth in this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection; for I would faine know in what age this man ſhould write. In the time of <hi>Moſes?</hi> how then could he write the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Iudges who ſucceeded him? In the time of the Iudges? how then could he write the hiſtorie of the Kings? What then? could he write theſe things in the time of the Kings, and ſo faine a relation of ſuch things as went before? why then it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that hee ſhould haue liued in the time of the laſt Kings, or els he could not haue penned their hiſtorie alſo: but before this time, there were many copies abroad of the Scriptures in diuers nations, by reaſon that the Iewes were ſcattered abroad through their captiuitie, where they as conſtantly profeſſed their religion as in their owne countrey. Beſides, if theſe writings had been fained, in what age could they come to light but men diligently inquiring into them, as being matters importing no leſſe than their eternall ſaluation or condemnation, would haue found them counterfeit? For if they had been penned in the ſame age wherein the things were done, who would haue beleeued them, if they did not aſſuredly know that they contained nothing but certaine truth? If in an after age, who would haue ſtraight ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed vnto them, vnleſſe they had by tradition from their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors bin aſſured that ſuch things were done in former times? Furthermore, it is not probable but that the Iewes would haue made mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch an author if they had known him; or if they had by ſome accident found them written in this forme, it is not likely that they would haue been ſo ſimple as to haue built their faith ſo firmely vpon them, that they would rather chuſe to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all torments than be brought to denie any one part of them.</p>

Now thirdly, if he cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men that the Scriptures are not the word of God, that ſo he may take away all the authority thereof, then he will take exceptions againſt the tranſlation; ſuggeſting into their minds, that though the Scriptures bee the word of God as they were penned in their own proper languages, by men inſpired by his ſpirit, yet for ought they know being vnlearned, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be corruptly tranſlated, altered from their firſt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and things added and detracted at the tranſlators pleaſure. To this I anſwere, that not onely profeſſors of religion, but alſo Pagans, Infidels, Epicures and Atheiſts, who are euen the very limmes of the diuell, haue been skilfull and learned in theſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; and therefore if the tranſlations were not neere the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall; who could ſtop their mouthes from inueighing againſt ſuch falſehood? Who could reſtraine them from declaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch corruption, ſeeing they ſo hate and abhor this truth, as that they wiſh the vtter extirpation thereof, and with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame malice oppoſe themſelues againſt it, perſecuting and murthering to their vttermoſt power, whoſoeuer imbrace and profeſſe it? Moreouer, we knowe that the Iewes who more mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly maligne Chriſtians and chriſtianity than the Turkes and Pagans, doe notwithſtanding agree with vs in the tranſlation of the old Teſtament, and can take no exception againſt the new. Thirdly, there hath been euer ſince Chriſts comming many ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries and heretikes, who for the maintenance of their opinions haue but ſought to corrupt ſome few places of the Scriptures, but ſtill God hath raiſed vp ſome godly learned in the originall tongues, who haue confuted them and cleered the text; how
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:23802:185"/>therefore in ſuch diuiſion and vehement diſcord ſhould ſuch a thing be concealed. How ſhould any corrupt the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or any principall places; ſeeing there is ſuch controuerſies from time to time about euery letter and ſyllable? Laſtly, this truth of the Scriptures hath been ſealed and confirmed with the blood of many Martyrs, who haue been excellently learned in the originall tongues: and who can imagine that they would haue been ſo fooliſh, as to haue giuen their liues for the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that truth which is contained in the Scriptures as we haue them tranſlated, if they thought them corrupted and falſified in the tranſlation?</p>

I anſwere, that though there be diuers tranſlations, and one better than another; yet euen that which is moſt corrupt and imperfect is ſufficient to inſtruct vs in the knowledge of God, and in the principles of Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; neither is there amongſt them all, many errors which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the articles of our faith, or come neere the ſubſtance of doctrine which we are bound to beleeue, for all the tranſlatours haue laboured to conforme their tranſlations according to the analogy of faith; and though they haue not in all places deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the proper ſenſe, yet they haue endeauored to come as neere it as they can, and where they haue fayled, it is rather in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances than in ſubſtance, in the proper and ſpeciall truth, than in the common and generall; and though in one place they do not ſo cleere the truth as they ſhould, yet they doe it in many other. And therefore let not Sathan perſwade vs to neglect the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe there are wants and imperfections in the tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for if we ſtudie and meditate euen in the meaneſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and frame our liues according to that trueth which wee learne out of them, wee ſhall attaine vnto euerlaſting life and happineſſe. Men doe not vſe to neglect their buſineſſe, becauſe by reaſon of ſome cloude the ſunne doth not ſhine vpon them in his full brightneſſe; for that light which they inioy is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, though not ſo gloriouſly bright as when it ſhineth in his full cleereneſſe: ſo we muſt not neglect the conforming of our ſelues to the Scriptures, becauſe we cannot ſee them ſhine in their own

Art thou ſo fooliſh (will he ſay) as to thinke all Goſpell which the miniſters teach, that all truth commeth from their mouthes, &amp; that there is not a more eaſie way of attaining to euerlaſting life, then that which they ſhew vnto thee? why, do but looke vpon themſelues and thouſhalt finde their liues farre diſſonant from their words, that whileſt they exhort thee to ſtricktnes, they take their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whileſt they diſſwade thee from taking thy pleaſure, affecting

Who therefore can imagine that they thinke as they ſpeake, or that they are perſwaded that heauen gate is ſo ſtraight, and the way ſo troubleſome and hard to finde, as they goe about to perſwade thee, ſeeing themſelues take the leaſt paines in walking in this way which they preſcribe vnto others? Or if it be the truth which they teach, then ſurely they are not worth the hearing who in their liues deny this truth which in their words they profeſſe; for what hope canſt thou haue that it will be powerfull to worke grace in thee, ſeeing it hath no power to worke it in themſelues? or that they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee to that holines, to which themſelues are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded?</p>

Firſt therefore,<note place="margin">Miniſters ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</note> whereas he ſaith that the miniſters ſpeak not as they think, becauſe they do not as the ſpeak; we are to know for the anſwering of this temptation, that miniſters are ſubiect to the ſame corruptions and infirmities which are incident vnto other men, and though they are called in the ſcriptures Angels in reſpect that they are Gods meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to bring and publiſh the glad tidings of the Goſpell, yet are they not Angels in reſpect of their puritie and perfection: but as they are fleſh and blood, ſubiect to all humane frailtie; as they are borne in ſinne and defiled with originall corruption, ſo are they as prone as others to fall into al actuall tranſgreſſions, if the Lord reſtraine them not. Neither muſt we imagine that learning and knowledge doe indue men with ſanctification and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing graces of Gods ſpirit, for then we might attaine vnto them by our ſtudie, labour and induſtrie; whereas the Scriptures teach vs that they are Gods free gifts which hee beſtoweth on whom
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:23802:187"/>he will; then it would follow that hee who is indued with moſt knowledge and learning, ſhould alſo haue moſt grace and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, whereas our owne experience teacheth vs, that many of the greateſt Doctors of the world ſpend their liues in all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous pleaſures and licentiouſneſſe. What then? doe theſe men teach one thing and beleeue another. Surely it may be the caſe of many, for faith commeth not by varietie of knowledge, neither is it tied to learning; but it is the free gift of God beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed as well, yea and as often alſo, vpon the ſimple fiſherman as vpon the learned Phariſie; and therefore though they haue ſuch great learning and knowledge, that they are able to inſtruct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and defend the truth againſt all oppoſers, yet may they be as hard hearted and full of infidelitie, as the moſt ignorant and ſottiſh in the world. Shall then their hardneſſe of heart and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie moue vs to call the truth of God which they deliuer into queſtion, as though it were a matter doubtfull whether it is the word of God or no? God forbid. Nay, let God be true and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man a liar. For their owne conſciences are conuinced of this truth though not perſwaded, and the Lord hath giuen them eies to ſee it, though not hearts to beleeue it; to the end that the praiſe of our ſaluation may wholy be aſcribed to his owne free grace, who calleth and iuſtifieth, ſanctifieth and ſaueth whom he will, and not vnto humane learning or knowledge, which may be attained vnto by mans induſtrie and labour.</p>
               <p>It may bee alſo that theſe who teach one thing and practiſe the cleane contrarie,<note place="margin">

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:23802:187"/>and carried away with the riches, honours and pleaſures of the world, as if we were ſtill moſt ſottiſhly ignorant. A notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hereof we haue in <hi>Salomon,</hi> who though hee had receiued ſuch a meaſure of wiſedome and diuine knowledge,<note place="margin">That neglect of dutie doth not alwaies argue incredulitie.</note> as neuer meere man attained vnto the like, yea though he were a penman of an excellent portion of holie Scriptures, yet the Lord leauing him to the corruption of his owne heart, he fell moſt grieuouſly into all abominable wickedneſſe: and yet who will dare to ſay, that <hi>Salomon</hi> did not write as he thought, and not rather that he was carried away through the violence of his corruptions, to commit that ſinne which his conſcience condemned, and to neglect obedience to Gods vndoubted truth? So <hi>Dauid</hi> who was indued with notable knowledge and no leſſe grace, fel not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding moſt fearefully into adulterie and murther; but ſhall we therefore thinke that he was not perſwaded that theſe were horrible ſinnes, or that when he commended mercie, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie and chaſtitie, he ſpake not as he thought? And <hi>Peter</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe denied and forſwore his maſter, whom before hee had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the ſonne of God; but ſhall wee hence conclude that <hi>Peter</hi> diſſembled when he made that notable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, becauſe when hee came to the triall hee vtterly diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it? Nay rather we may certainly be perſwaded, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was carried away with his luſt and concupiſcence, and <hi>Peter</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome with feare and frailtie, and both drawne, through their corruption, to commit thoſe ſinnes which their conſciences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demened. But leauing ſuch farre fetcht inſtances, let euery man, yea euen he who hath attained vnto the greateſt meaſure of faith and ſanctification, enter into a ſtrict and due conſideration with himſelfe, and examine his owne conſcience before Gods tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſeate; and then let him tell me whether hee perfourme obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all that truth which hee knoweth and beleeueth, or whether he may not iuſtly complaine, that our corruption takes occaſion by the knowledge of Gods commandement, to work in vs all manner of concupiſcence; that hee doth thoſe things which he alloweth not, nay which he hateth and abhorreth; that though hee doe not onely know the law of God, but alſo is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted therewith in the inner man, yet that there is another law in his members which rebelleth atainſt the law of his mind,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.8.15.23.</note> and leadeth him captiue vnto the law of ſinne, as it is Rom. 7.8.15.23.
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:23802:188"/>And if this be the caſe of <hi>Salomon, Dauid, Peter,</hi> and of all Gods children, who haue attained to the greateſt meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſanctification; let not Sathan perſwade vs that wee may ſafely neglect the miniſterie of the word, becauſe the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters thereof ſeeme not perſwaded that the doctrine which they deliuer is true, in that they do not practiſe it in their own liues: for many knowing and beleeuing that truth which they deliuer, are notwithſtanding deſtitute of the ſanctifying graces of Gods ſpirit, and therefore wholy carried away into all licentious wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe; and many alſo who are ſanctified, being not wholy purged from their naturall corruptions, are readie to ſhew their frailtie and infirmties to all the world, though they know, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, beleeue, and from their hearts embrace, that truth which they teach and profeſſe.</p>

Which temptation of sathan is moſt dangerous and pernicious vnto many: for what greater diſcouragement can there be to a ſicke patient, than to take phyſicke of ſuch a Phyſition who can not cure himſelfe of the ſame diſeaſe? Or who will willingly eate of that foode, which he who giueth it vnto him ſo loatheth and abhorreth, that he will not ſo much as taſte of it? Or who taketh delight in hearing him diſcourſe of mercie, chaſtitie, and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, whom he knoweth wholy poſſeſſed of crueltie, luſt, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe? And therefore it were to be wiſhed that Gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould be Phyſitions to themſelues, before they take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the cure of others; that they ſhould not ſtand like Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by the high way ſides, directing others in their iourneys, themſelues neuer mouing foot, but that they ſhould like guides goe before them, and inſtruct them not only by their word, but alſo moue them to receiue their inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their example.

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:23802:188"/>vs of this heauenly Manna and foode of our ſoules, whereby all the graces of Gods ſpirit are begotten,<note place="margin">That the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe ſhould not make vs neglect hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> nouriſhed and increaſed in vs, becauſe the miniſter who offreth it vnto vs doth not feede vpon it himſelfe. And to this end we are to know that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the word is Gods ordinance, which dependeth not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the worthineſſe of him who deliuereth it, neither is it made voide and vneffectuall by his vnworthineſſe; but it hath it vertue force and power from the bleſſing of God, and from the inward operation of his ſpirit, who applieth it to the hearts and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, and thereby illuminates their vnderſtandings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth faith in them and all ſanctifying and ſauing graces. And hence it is, that the miniſter himſelf, findeth not the word which he deliuereth, effectual for the begetting of faith or any grace in him, which notwithſtanding is powerfull in many of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers for theſe purpoſes, becauſe the Lord vouchſafeth not the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and inward cooperation of his holy ſpirit with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward miniſterie of the word vnto him, which notwithſtanding he mercifully granteth vnto others. Seeing then the miniſterie of the word is Gods owne ordinance, which he maketh effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to whom hee will by the inward operation of his holy ſpirit, by whomſoeuer it is deliuered; and ſeeing thoſe miniſters which are moſt holy and vertuous cannot at their pleaſure infuſe grace into their hearers; for <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollos may water, but God giueth the increaſe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1.

Laſtly, ſeeing the wiſedome of God thinketh it good to ſend ambaſſadours of both ſorts, ſanctified and vnſanctified, and oftentimes maketh the word in the mouth fo a faithfull and godly miniſter the ſauour of death vnto death, and the ſame word in the mouth of one who is voide of grace and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:23802:189"/>the ſauour of life vnto life, to the end that we ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon man, but wholy reſt and relie our ſelues vpon Gods owne ordinance, giuing and aſcribing vnto him the whole glory and praiſe of our conuerſion and ſaluation; let not Sathan per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs to thinke the worſe of the pure word of God, becauſe of his corruption who deliuereth it: for what were this but to refuſe a comfortable ambaſſage from a gracious prince, becauſe we diſlike the qualities of the ambaſſadours? what were this but to ſcorne to receiue a kind letter from a louing father, becauſe the carrier doth diſpleaſe vs? what is this but to refuſe a rich treaſure, becauſe it is brought vnto vs in an earthen veſſell which is fraile and brittle? what is it but like proud beggers to refuſe the bountifull almes of a mercifull prince, becauſe it is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs by an Amner which is couetous and hard harted? Yea what is it but to croſſe our Sauiour Chriſts expreſſe commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who commanded all to heare euen the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies who ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> and to do after their words though not after their workes?

But if he cannot thus preuaile, he leaueth their liues and commeth to their doctrine. Doeſt thou not ſee (will he ſay) that there are innumerable ſects and contrary factions amongſt thoſe who profeſſe Chriſtianitie? ſome Papiſts, ſome Proteſtants, ſome Arians, ſome Anabaptiſts, ſome Pelagians, ſome Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, ſome Familiſts, ſome Donatiſts, &amp; many other who all cite and alledge Scriptures for the defending of their contrarie opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:23802:189"/>&amp; confidently affirme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they only haue the truth amongſt them? how therfore canſt thou know which is truth and which is falſehood; who interpret the ſcriptures aright, and who wreſt and miſconſter them? or if thou wert diſpoſed to be religious, what religion wilt thou profeſſe in this great confuſion? to what Church wilt thou adioyne thy ſelfe ſeeing one is contrarie to another, and thou knoweſt not which is in the truth? If thou beeſt wiſe therefore keepe thy ſelfe quiet and let all alone, harken not to any of them, or if thou doſt, beleeue them not ouer haſtily, be of that religion which will beſt ſtand with thine aduantage; or if thou wilt needes ſerue God, follow thine owne conſcience, haue a good intention in that thou doeſt, and it is enough; but profeſſe not one religion more than another, till thou ſeeſt thoſe who are learned agree amongſt themſelues, for vntill then thou canſt haue no aſſurance that thou profeſſeſt the truth.

And the experience of al times both vnder the law, &amp; vnder the Goſpel, may ſufficiently teach vs that whereſoeuer the truth of God is publiſhed and preached, there it is oppoſed by innumerable ſectaries and heretikes, which by the malice and ſubtiltie of Sathan, are ſtirred vp to impugne and diſcredit the true religion: and therefore if Sathan can ſtill keepe vs blindfoulded in ignorance, and reſtraine vs from the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and profeſſion of our faith, till there be a generall vnitie and agreement in the true religion, without all oppoſition or gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying, then he hath attained his deſire; for ſo ſhall we neuer ioyne our ſelues in the communion of the ſaints, nor bee true members of the Church, profeſſing &amp; practizing the religion of Ieſus Chriſt, ſeeing the diuell will not ceaſe to ſtir vp his wicked inſtruments, falſe Prophets, ſecraties and heretikes, to the end they may oppugne and contradict the truth when it is ſincerely preached, and make it fruteleſſe in the hearts of vnbeleeuers; ſeeing alſo our Sauiour hath taught vs that his Church is but a little flocke, which is aſſaulted and grieuouſly vexed, not onely with Lyons, Tigers and open enemies, but alſo with Foxes, and Wolues in ſheepes clothing, and ſecret enemies who vnder the ſhew and profeſſion of religion, ſeeke to vndermine and bring
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:23802:190"/>it to ruine. And the Apoſtle alſo hath forewarned vs that <hi>there muſt be hereſies among vs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.19.</note> 
                  <hi>that they who are approoued might be knowne.</hi> 1. Cor. 11.19. Though therefore there be many ſects, and hereſies, many falſe religions, and but one truth, this muſt not make vs to neglect all, till there be an vniuerſall agreement, for as well may be reconcile light and darkenes, the children of God with the children of the diuell, grace &amp; naturall corruption, truth and error, as the true religion with thoſe which are falſe, or the profeſſors of the one with the profeſſors of the other.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who haue important buſineſſes abroad, doe not ſtay at home and refuſe to trauaile becauſe ſome goe out of the way; but therefore they are more carefull to informe themſelues of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery turning in their iourney, becauſe they would not erre with others: thoſe that haue a deſire to liue, doe not refuſe all meate becauſe ſome ſurfet &amp; die, by eating that which is vnwholſome; but rather hereby they are made more warie in making good choyſe of ſuch diet as is fit for the preſeruation of their health: thoſe alſo who are ſicke, doe not neglect all phiſicke, becauſe there are many couſening Impoſters and vnlearned Emperickes who kil in ſted of curing; but this maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection to find out a skilful and learned phiſition.

               <p>But there it will be demaunded how thoſe who are ſimple and ignorant can iudge which is the true religion,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>§.</hi> Sect. <hi>2.</hi> How the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned may diſcerne the true religion from that which is falſe.</note> and which is the falſe, who teacheth the truth and who falſehood? to which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that euery one muſt labour to informe himſelfe of the truth, by ſtudying and meditating in Gods word: this muſt be his light to guide him, his counſaylor to informe him, his touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone whereby he may diſcerne the ſtubble and ſtraw of mens inuentions, from the pure gold of Gods true religion. Neither are we to receiue all doctrines hand ouer head, but as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:23802:190"/>exhorteth vs, we <hi>muſt trie the ſpirits whether they be of God or no:</hi> and with the men of Berea, we muſt ſearch the ſcriptures,<note place="margin">I. Ioh. 4.1. Act. 17.</note> to ſee if thoſe things be ſo as they are deliuered, and accordingly either receiue them if they are conſonant with Gods word, or reiect them if they be diſſonant thereunto. Yea (will ſome ſay) this were a direct courſe if thoſe onely who haue the truth on their ſide had ſcripture to alledge, but ſeeing euery heretike is as readie to quote ſcripture, for the vpholding and defending of his hereſie, as the profeſſors of Gods truth for the maintenance thereof; all the queſtion is, whoſe interpretation is to be receiued as good, and whoſe to be reiected as falſe and erroneous? To this I anſwere, that though there be ſome places in the ſcripture hard and ſomewhat doubtful, and therefore the more eaſie to be wreſted vnto a wrong ſenſe, yet are there others cleare end eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, for the confuting of all ſects, hereſies, and errors whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer: and therefore we muſt expound thoſe places which are darke and ambiguous, by thoſe which are perſpicuous and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. For exmaple, if we would know whether Poperie be the true religion or no, we muſt examine the doctrines thereof by Gods word, not making choyſe of thoſe places which ſeeme any way hard and doubtfull, but of thoſe which are cleere and manifeſt; and ſo we ſhall finde that their doctrines are as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to Gods truth, as light to darkenes. For whereas they teach that we are able to fulfill the law, and to merit heauen, the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures affirme the cleane contrarie,<note place="margin">I am. 3.2. and 2.10.</note> namely that <hi>in many things we ſinne all,</hi> I am. 3.2. <hi>and whoſoeuer ſhall keepe the whole law yet fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in one point is guiltie of all,</hi> I am. 2.10. <hi>that there is no man who ſinneth not,</hi>

Whereas they teach that we muſt make and worſhip images, both are expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the ſecond commaundement, and in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſcripture. Whereas they teach that the ſcriptures ſhould be kept from the common people, in an vnknowne language; the Apoſtle plainely affirmeth that he had rather in the Church ſpeake fiue words with his vnderſtanding, that he might alſo inſtruct other,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.19.</note> than ten thouſand words in a ſtrange tongue; and flatly inioyneth that the Prophets ſhould keepe ſilence in the Church, rather than ſpeake ſtrange lauguages, where there is no interpreter, 1. Cor. 14.19.27.28. Whereas they hold that the cup in the adminiſtration of the Lords ſupper, is to be withheld from the common people, and giuen onely to the Prieſts, the quite contrarie is to be obſerued in the inſtitution, whereas our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Drinke ye all of it, becauſe it is his blood of the new teſtament that is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſinnes:</hi> plainely thereby inferring, that this ſigne and ſacrament of his blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to as many as were redeemed by it,<note place="margin">Matth, 26.28.</note> Matth. 26.28. And whereas they ſay that here the diſciples were onely, and that to them alone this ſpeech was directed, the Apoſtle plainely taketh away this cauill: for ſetting downe the words of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution for the vſe of the whole Church of Corinth, hee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth euery one indefinitly to examine himſelfe and ſo to eate of this breade and drinke of this cuppe.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.28.</note> 1. Corinth. 11.28. And thus if wee ſtudie and meditate in Gods word, wee ſhall find moſt cleere &amp; manifeſt places for the confirmation of the truth, and confutation of all ſects errors and hereſies. But what if this meanes be taken away from vs, of reading &amp; ſtudying the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, either becauſe they are onely to bee had in an vnknowne language, as in the time of popery, or becauſe we cannot reade
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:23802:191"/>and haue no body to teach vs? What if both reading and ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, we finde many doubts and difficulties, and diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which ſeeme to fauour diuers and oppoſite opinions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions? how the muſt we quit our ſelues out of this laberinth of ambiguitie and doubtfulneſſe, ſeeing it is preiudiciall to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the iudgement of either faction? I anſwere, that in theſe dayes the meanes of knowledge are not ſo ſcant, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may inioy them that labour for them; for either they may obtaine the vſe of the Scriptures in their owne language where they dwel, or elſe in ſome other place by remouing their habitation; &amp; though they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not reade, yet it is no hard matter to learne, to thoſe who will vſe paines and diligence, or at leaſt to get the helpe of others to ſupplie their want and defect in this behalfe. But let it bee granted that we were abandoned of all theſe meanes, or that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, there were ſome doubt remaining of which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſolued; are we therefore deſtitute of helpe, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of all meanes, whereby wee might attaine vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth? No ſurely. For, if when allother meanes faile vs, we haue our recourſe vnto God by earneſt &amp; effectual prayer, inſtantly crauing his holy ſpirit to guide and direct vs, we haue a mercifull promiſe that he will heare our requeſt and graunt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs his holy ſpirit, as it is Luke 11.13.<note place="margin">Luke 11.13.</note> and that thereby he will illuminate the blinde eyes of our vnderſtanding, inlighten our minds with the knowledge of the truth, and take away from vs all preiudice of opinion and foreſtalled iudgement, ſo as we ſhal diſcerne truth from falſehood, and Gods true religion, from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and lies, ſects and hereſies.<note place="margin">Iohn 16.13.</note> For <hi>this ſpirit of truth will leade vs into al truth,</hi> as it is Ioh. 16.13. <hi>He ſearcheth al things,</hi>

For the anſwering of which temptation, wee are to know, firſt, that our ſinnes and vnworthineſſe ſhould be ſo farre from hindring vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hearing of Gods words, that they ſhould rather ſerue as forcible arguments to moue vs more attentiuely and diligently to heare it: becauſe it is the meanes ordayned of God to pull vs out of our ſins, to purge vs from our corruptions, to worke in vs true ſanctification, and to make vs of the ſonnes of wrath the children of God. Moreouer, though we want faith and all other ſanctifying graces, yet we are to heare the word of God: for therefore the Lord hath ordained the miniſtery of the word, not onely to increaſe grace where it is begun, but alſo to beget and begin it where it is wanting; ſo that we muſt not only heare becauſe we are fit, but alſo that we may be made fit, who before were vnfit. Neither are we to imagine that faith and other graces goe before hearing, but follow after as fruits and effects thereof;<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.17.</note> as the Apoſtle plainely ſheweth, Rom. 10.14. <hi>But how ſhall they call on him in whom they haue not beleeued? And how ſhall they
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:23802:192"/>beleeue in him of whom they haue not heard? And how ſhall they heare without a Preacher?</hi> And verſe 17. <hi>Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> If then there be no faith without hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, nor no grace without faith, it muſt needs follow, that before we heare, we are deſtitute of faith &amp; all ſauing grace, and that by hearing they are wrought in vs, God preuenting vs with his grace, and calling vs vnto himſelfe, not only when we had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts to merit his mercy, but alſo not ſo much as any grace to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it. And hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, 2. Tim. 1.9. That <hi>God hath called vs with an holy calling, not according to our works,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.9.</note> 
                  <hi>but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own purpoſe and grace, which was giuen vnto vs through Christ Ieſus before the world was.</hi> The truth hereof may appeare in all the examples of Gods ſaints, who before their calling were ſo far from deſeruing any grace at Gods hand, that rather they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued confuſion &amp; vtter deſtruction. For example, what worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was in <hi>Abraham</hi> before his conuerſion who liued in groſſe idolatry? what worthines in <hi>Rahab</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harlot? in <hi>Manaſſes</hi> a cruell tirant, a wicked ſorcerer, an horrible idolater? what worthines in <hi>Marie Magdalene</hi> poſſeſſed by ſeuen diuels? or in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Zacheus</hi> the Publicanes? or in <hi>Paul</hi> who perſecuted the Church of God? In a word, what worthines is in any of Gods ſaints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord by the preaching of his word, made effectuall by the inward operation of his ſpirit, hath called and conuerted, and pulled them out of their ſins and corruptions in which they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and indued them with ſome meaſure of his ſanctifying and ſauing graces?</p>

And as citizens being beſieged with their enemies, doe learne by their aſſaulting which part of the citie is moſt weake, and ſo with more care and labour fortifie it, with men and munition, trenches and bulworkes; ſo when we who are continually beſieged by our ſpirituall enemies, doe learne by their aſſaulting of vs where we are weakeſt, and the enemie moſt like to enter, then we muſt goe into Gods armorie and prouide ſufficient weapons and munition, whereby we may be

For example, he who findeth his heart hard and ſecure, muſt feede vpon the threatnings of the law, to the end he may be humbled, and his heart molified, and reſolued into teares of vnfained repentance; he that is of a broken heart and contrite ſpirit, muſt feede vpon the ſweete and gracious promiſes of the Goſpell; he that is ignorant, muſt hunger after milke, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be inſtructed in the principles of religion; he that hath a good meaſure of knowledge, may deſire ſtronger meate, that is, attend vnto the more deepe poynts of diuinitie; in a word, euery man is to examine his particular ſtate, and to ſearch out his greateſt wants, that ſo comming to heare the word, he may more diligently apply ſuch doctrines, inſtructions, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as ſhall bee moſt fit for his vſe and benefit; for that which is foode to one is poyſon to another, and that ſalue which is fit to heale one ſore, doth make another to feſter and ranckell, and one part of the word of God being applied to men of diuers eſtates, doth worke diuers effects, one it feedeth, another it poyſoneth, one it healeth another it woundeth, to one it is the ſauour of life vnto life, and to another it is the ſauour of death vnto death: and therefore before we come to the hearing thereof, we are to examine our ſtates that we may apply and make profitable vſe to our ſelues of that which is moſt fit to nouriſh and ſtrengthen vs in Gods graces.</p>

Now the meanes to preſerue and nouriſh this heauenly ſeed of Gods word is firſt ſerious mediation; wherby wee call to mind that which wee haue heard, in which it it is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that wee examine the doctrines which were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to the touchſtone of Gods word, and turne ouer the bible to thoſe proofes which we remember alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as moſt principall for the confirmation of the doctrines which were deliuered: a notable example whereof we haue in the noble men of <hi>Berea.</hi> Actes. 17.10.11. Who though with great readineſſe they receiued that doctrine which Paul had deliuered yet when they came home they ſearched the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:23802:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſcriptures to ſee if thoſe things which they hard were conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and agreeable with them or no.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt vſe holy and Chriſtian conference one with another, about thoſe matters which we haue heard, for hereby it will come to paſſe that what one did not obſerue or hath forgotten, the other remembreth and repenteth, and ſo likewiſe the other helpeth out in another point where his neighbourfaileth, till at laſt they recall al the material points to their remembrance, euen as many meeting together at a feaſt do euery one caſt in his ſhot til the reckoning be made, ſo many ioyning their heads together for the recalling of a ſermon to mind, one repeateth a little and another as much more, till at laſt all be repeated. And ſecondly, this benefit redoundeth hereof that all which euery one remembreth by this repetition is more ſurely imprinted in his memorie and is not afterwards eaſily forgotten.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the beſt and ſureſt way to imprint things in our memorie neuer after to be blotted out, is vpon all occaſions to practiſe it in our liues and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation, for as we only truly know that in chriſtianitie that which we practiſe, ſo likewiſe that is onely well remembred which is well practiſed.</p>

So Leuit. 3.1. the Lord requireth that the ſacrifice which they offered ſhould be without blemiſh, and 22.20. <hi>Ye ſhall not offer any thing that hath a blemiſh for that ſhall not be acceptable for you.</hi> And Deut. 15.21. <hi>if there be any blemiſh therein as if it be lame or blind, or haue any euill fault thou ſhalt not offer it vnto the Lord thy God.</hi> And for tranſgreſſing this law the Lord reprehendeth the people by his Prophet. Mal. 1.8. <hi>And if ye offer the blind for ſacrifice is it not euill? and if ye offer the lame and ſicke is it not euill? offer it now to thy Prince; will he be content with thee or accept thy perſon ſaith the Lord of hoaſtes.</hi> And verſ. 14. <hi>Curſed be the deceiuer which hath in his flocke a male and voweth, and ſacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing.</hi> Now did the Lord regard the beaſts, and hath he made ſo many lawes that he might haue the beſt of them? ſurely this is not Gods mayne end, but hee would thereby teach vs
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:23802:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>to offer and dedicate vnto his ſeruice euen our beſt things as the prime of our youth &amp; our flouriſhing age, for was the Lord greatly offended when as men reſerued the beſt of the flocke to themſelues and offred the old, blind and lame vnto him; and will he be well pleaſed that we ſhould dedicate our youth and the ſtrength of body and ſoule vnto Sathan, and our owne luſtes and reſerue for him onely our old decrepit lame and withered age, when as our bodies are full of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and our mindes of infirmities? will any Prince accept of vs if we ſpend the whole time of our youth and ſtrength in the ſeruice of his enemies, and when we are ſicke, old, lame &amp; blind, offer him our ſeruice, and will the Prince of Princes thinke hee be well pleaſed if he be thus vſed? if Sathan and the world haue all the pure wine will he be contented with the lees and dregs, if they haue the ripe fruite, will God haue that which is rotten and putrified. If they haue our health wil he haue our ſickneſſe? ſurely it is not likely; for the Lord who hath created vs redeemed vs and doth preſerue vs, doth looke to be ſerued with our youth health and ſtrength which he hath beſtowed on vs.</p>

Motiue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the momentany ſhortneſſe of mans life.</note>The ſecond argument to mooue vs to haſten our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and turning vnto God is taken from the momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſhortneſſe and the mutable vncertainty of our liues; in reſpect of the ſhortneſſe of our liues they are compared to a pilgrimage, to the flower and graſſe of the field, to the wind, a cloud, ſmoke, vapour, to a dreame, a tale tould, a ſpanne ſhadow, and the paſſage of the weauers ſhuttle, yea it is called vanitie it ſelfe. And therefore ſeeing our liues are ſo ſhort ſurely they are al to little though they were wholy ſpent in Gods ſeruice; but ſeeing wee haue ſpent a great part of this ſhort time euen our whole life before our conuerſion after the luſts of the gentiles, let vs thinke that inough yea farre too much to be ſo ill beſtowed, <hi>and from hence for ward let vs liue (as much time as remaineth in the fleſh) not after the luſts of men but after the will of God,</hi> as the apoſtle admoniſheth vs. 1. Pet. 4.2.3. But though our life were ſhort yet if this ſhort time were certain there were ſome more ſhew of reaſon why
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:23802:199"/>we ſhould defer our conuerſion; but as it is ſhort ſo is it moſt vncertaine, for wee haue not aſſurance that wee ſhall liue one hower, wee are tenants at will in theſe earthly taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, neither doe wee know how ſoone our great landlord will turne vs out of them; wee are the Lords ſtewards here on earth and we know not how ſoone our Lord and maſter will call vs to a reckoninge and therefore it behoueth vs to haue our accompts alwayes perfect and the bookes of our conſciences made vp in readineſſe. We are vncertaine when death will arreſt vs and carry vs to iudgment and therefore we ſhould be prepared for it all times; when wee goe to bed we are ſo to lay vs downe as though we were neuer to riſe til we riſe to receiue our laſt ſentence, when we riſe vp in the morning wee are ſo to ſpend that day as though it were the laſt of our liues, for how many haue gone well to bed who haue beene dead before the morning? how many haue riſen (as they thought in perfect health) and yet haue beene at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached by death before the euening? and therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth euery one who hath any regarde of the eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his ſoule to turne ſpeedily vnto God, and while to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day they heare his voice not to harden their heartes. Men vſually delaie matters of leaſt waight and in the firſt place diſpatch buſineſſe of greateſt importance, and therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we thinke the preſeruing of our bodies and ſoules from the eternall torments of hell fire and the aſſurance of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe in Gods kingdome to be matters of leſſe importance, then the obtaining of ſome vain pleaſures, vnconſtant honours or baſe commodities, let vs turne vnto the Lord betimes by vnfained repentance and according to our ſauiours aduiſe. Matth. 6.33. <hi>Let vs firſt ſeeke the kingdome of God and the righteouſneſſe therof, and then worldly neceſſaries ſhalbe caſt vnto vs as a vantage in this maine bargaine.</hi> If our houſes were on fire we would ſeeke firſt to preſerue thoſe things which are moſt deare and pretious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs good houſhould ſtuffe before lumber, Iewels before ſtuffe, and children before Iewels, but our liues are dayly in a conſumption <hi>et dum creſcimus vita, decreſcit,</hi> whilſt wee

But moſt lamentable is the practiſe of moſt who liue as though they were neuer to die, or as though they had taken of God a long leaſe of their liues which is to expire at a certaine appointed time; and this makes them deferre their repentance and to put the euill day far from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, til at laſt death attacheth them &amp; carrieith them to iudgment; and this appeareth by the ſcripturs and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual experience.

But this is the beſt which can befall vs, for if we doe not thus hartely ſorrowe for our ſinnes, but ſtill liue in them with pleaſure and delight, then doe wee nothing elſe but heape vp iudgement, and puniſhments, which ſhall one day bee powred vpon vs in full meaſure, and fill vp the vialls of Gods wrath, till being filled vp to the brimme, hee will powre them out vpon our one heades. And this the Apoſtle plainely ſheweth. Rom. 2.5. <hi>But thou (ſaith hee) after thine hardneſſe and heart that cannot repent, heapeſt

Iame. 5.3. The longer therefore wee deferre our repentance the more wee increaſe the bills of accoumpts, of which wee ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee able to giue a reckoning, at the great, and generall audit, the more wee heape vp our ſinnes, the more wee heape vp Gods wrath; and increaſe the meaſure of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and helliſh tormentes euery day, (as it were) pyling vp wood, in which we ſhall eternally be burned.</p>

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:23802:207"/>and taſt of that liquor which was put into it whileſt it was new and vnſeaſoned, ſo they will longeſt retaine vertue and goodneſſe who haue it planted in them in their youth, accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to that Pro. 22.6, teach a child in the trade of his way, and when he is old he will not depart from it. Secondly if we turne to God betimes the exerciſes of religion, and workes of ſanctification, will be farre more pleaſant and eaſie then if we deferre them till our old age, for often vſe will bringe vs to a cuſtome, and long cuſtome will worke in vs an habite of vertue, which will be eaſie and familiar, if children from their youth be brought vp in trades and occupations which are exceeding hard and difficult, they do attaine to the skill and practiſe of them with exceeding dexteritie and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but if the learning of them be deferred till old age they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer attaine vnto them, or at leaſt performe them ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with great difficultie, and ſo if from our childhood wee, accuſtome our ſelues to the learning and practiſe of the workes of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, they will growe exceeding eaſie and pleaſant, whereas being deferred they wilbe difficult and tedious. If the oxe whileſt he is yong be accuſtomed to the yoke hee draweth in it quietly and with no great paine, but if he runne long in the paſture vnbroken and vntamed, when he is brought to the yoke he ſtrugleth and ſtriueth, and therewith gaulling his necke draweth with exceeding payne and irkſomeneſſe; and ſo if in our youth we accuſtome ourſelues to beare the yoke of obedience, it wilbe eaſie and pleaſant, but if we vſe delayes we ſhall grow ſtubborne and ſtifnecked like vntamed oxen, and the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Chriſts yoke through our impaciencie, and the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of our nature will gaule and vexe vs. Thirdly, the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wee turne vnto God, the more ioy, peace and comfort ſhall we haue in the whole courſe of our liues, for what ioy may bee compared with the ioy in the holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Pro. 15.15.</note> what peace is like the peace with God; &amp; the peace of conſcience, when as we are ſure that we are now friends, who before we were enemies and children of God and heires of his euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting kingdome of glory, who in time paſt were children of

Whereas on the other ſide if we deferre our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, in the meane while wee are continually ſubiect to the checkes and terrours of an euill conſcience, in feare of Gods iudgements and eternall damnation: and though in outward ſhewe wee may bee exceeding merie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, yet our mirth is ful of ſorrow, and our ioy of bitternes, and of <hi>ſuch laughter wee may ſay, thou art madde, and of this ioy what is that which thou doeſt?</hi> as the Wiſe man ſpeaketh, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. 2.2. for it is but <hi>Sardonicus riſus</hi> laughter from the teeth outward, which is ſtraight controuled with ſome inward pange or checke of conſcience. Fourthly, the ſooner wee turne vnto the Lord; the longer time we ſhall ſpend in his ſeruice, which in truth is perfect liberty, now what can bee more delightful vnto any Chriſtian heart, then to ſerue our creatour from the daies of our youth, &amp; to ſhew our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God our redeemer for all the ineſtimable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which he hath beſtowed vpon vs, by cauſing our lights to ſhine before men, and by glorifying his name in our god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; Chriſtian liues? what can be more pleaſing to a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mind then to take all occaſions of expreſſing thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to him vnto whom we are ſo much bounden? Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as by our ſpeedy conuerſion vnto God we liue in ſweete comfort and ioyfull peace, ſo alſo wee ſecurely expect death and giue it entertainement when it commeth with cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenance, for being conuerted vnto God we are at peace with him and in his loue and fauour, wee are aſſured that the curſe of the law is nayled to Chriſtes croſſe, that he was condemned that we might be iuſtified and put to death that wee might liue eternally, that he is gone before vs into
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:23802:208"/>heauen to prepare vs a place there, and now ſitteth at the right hand of his father to giue vs ioyfull entertainement when we come vnto him, that he hath taken away the ſting of death which is ſinne, and hath made a ſoueraigne medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine againſt this poyſon with his precious bloud, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being conuerted vnto God we need not to feare death, nay rather wee may wiſhe with the Apoſtle to be ſpeedily <hi>diſſolued that we may be with Chriſt ſeeing that is beſt of all.</hi> As it is Phil. 1.23. neyther need wee to feare the deſtruction of this earthly tabernacle, ſeeing <hi>wee are aſſured that we haue a building giuen vs of God, a houſe not made with hands but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in the heauens.</hi> as it is 2.

                  <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> neither can he die ill who hath liued well. On the other ſide thoſe who deferre their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and turning vnto God, when death approcheth are filled with horrour &amp; feare when as they ſee that they are ſtill ſubiect to the curſe of the law and euery minute in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Gods fearfull iudgements; when as the waight of ſin preſſeth them, Sathan and their owne conſcience accuſeth them, death waiteth on them to bring them to euerlaſting death, hell, and deſtruction. And therefore ſeeing ſo many benefits accompanie our ſpeedy conuerſion both in life and death, and ſo many euils follow our delayes: let vs not be moued by Sathans tentations, the ſweeteneſſe of ſinne, nor with the alluring vanities of this deceitfull world to deferre our repentance from day to day, but let vs now harken whileſt God, yet calleth vs, and take the good and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time when he offereth it vnto vs.</p>

But let it be granted (as in trueth it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee denied) that whenſoeuer wee truely repent vs of our ſinnes and turne vnto God he wil receiue vs to mercy, ſhould wee take occaſion hereof to deferre our conuerſion and to continue in our ſinnes? ſhould his loue and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towardes vs mooue vs to rebellion, and impietie, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and becauſe hee is gratious and long ſuffering ſhall we therfore the more offend him, and as it were whet the edge of his wrath againſt vs? be it farre from vs. Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if God be gratious and mercifull, let vs bee aſhamed to offend ſo gratious and mercifull a God, and though wee ſhoulde bee ſo hard harted as not to feare his iuſtice, and fearefull iudgementes, yet euen in common humanitie let vs bluſh for ſhame to offende him in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his infinite loue, and mercie.

Wee knowe that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelfe when hee was vexed with Gods fearefull plagues,<note place="margin">Exod. 9.27. &amp; 10.16.17.</note> could ſay I haue ſinned, and promiſe amendment, And <hi>Saul,</hi> when God threatned to cut him off, and to take the kingdome from him, could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his wickedneſſe, and pretend a deſire to worſhip the Lord.

And who may not obſerue in his owne experience, how many there are who in the time of their ſickeneſſe, make godly ſhewes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, promiſing goulden mountaynes and vowing if they recouer, that they will leade a newe life, forſaking their ſinnes, and indeuouring to ſerue the Lorde in the duties of holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, and yet the ſame men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtored to their heath, with the dogge returne to their vomit, and with the ſowe to wallowe againe in the filthie puddle of ſinne, becomming as prophaine, wicked, irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and negligent in all duties of chriſtianitie, as euer they
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:23802:210"/>were; which is a moſt vndoubted ſigne, that there repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was but faigned, and diſſembled, and that they were mooued thereunto not for any loue of God, or hatred of ſinne, but for feare of Gods iudgmentes, and eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and therefore as ſoone as the cauſe of their feare is a little remooued, their repentance alſo ceaſeth. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer wee knowe that true repentance is the gifte of God, and that we haue it not at our owne beck and call, but when he offereth and vouchſaueth it vnto vs, and therefore it is no maruaile if they who haue ſcorned this gratious gift all the whole courſe of their liues, ſhould be denied it at the time of death, &amp; left ſo to the hardnes of their harts, that though with Eſau they ſeeke repentance with teares, yet they ſhall neuer find it. And though with the fiue fooliſh virgins they deſire to buy oyle for their lamps, yet the time of grace being paſt they ſhall be ſhut out of doores and excluded from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Neither doth the Lord ordmarily beget faith,<note place="margin">Eph 4.11.12.</note> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and other ſanctifying graces in any man, but by the vſe of the meanes which he hath ordayned for this purpoſe; now the meanes ordained of God are not ſickneſſe or the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of old age, but the miniſterie of his word, made effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all by the inward operation of his ſpirit for our conuerſion &amp; ſanctification; and therefore if the Lord hath oftentimes grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vs this meanes, and they haue not beene effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for our conuerſion if hee haue often called vs in the preaching of the word and wee haue refuſed to come, what hope can we haue that wee ſhould turne vnto God,<note place="margin">John 6.44.</note> without this meanes in the time of ſickeneſſe, who by the continuall hearing of the word haue not beene conuerted in the time of our health, ſeeing not any come vnto Chriſt but whom the father draweth, and the meanes whereby he draweth vs vnto him, is not ſickeneſſe or the approching of death ordinarily, but the miniſterie of his word; for when the ſheepe heare Chriſts voyce and thereby knowe him to bee the true ſhee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheard. then (and not before) they follow him as it is Iohn. 10.27. So that though we were ſicke and certainely aſſured wee ſhould die to morrow, yet for all this, wee are neuer the neerer our conuerſion, faith, and repentance then we were
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:23802:210"/>before; as appeareth in the example of the Epicures. 1. Cor. 15.32. <hi>Let vs eate and drinke</hi> (ſay they) <hi>for to morrow we ſhall die</hi> a man would thinke they ſhould rather haue ſayd, let vs faſt and pray for to morrow we ſhall die; but this plainly ſheweth that we are neuer the neerer our conuerſion vnto God, and true repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance though we are certaine that death approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; it is onely the worke of Gods ſpirite, which ordinarily worketh not by the means of ſickneſſe or feare of death, but by the miniſterie of the word which is Gods owne ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.11.12.</note> 
                  <hi>inſtituted of God for the gathering together of the Saints, and for the edification of the body of Chriſt.</hi> And therefore whileſt the Lord calleth vs in the preaching of the word, let vs harken vnto his voice, and turne vnto him by vnfained repentance, for if Gods owne ordinance is not effectuall for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, aſſuredly there is no hope that euer we will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by ſicknes or any other extraordinarie meanes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. It is an admirable miracle wrought by the infinite wiſedome and almighty power of God, that a poore ſinner ſhould be conuerted vnto him by the preaching of the word, for hereby we who were dead in ſinne, are raiſed vp to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life, we who were borne blind, are indued with ſight, our hearts more hard then the Adamant are made flexible, and ſoft as waxe to receaue any impreſſion, which the Lord wilimprint in them, and wee are moued to denie our ſelues, and to caſt away our owne righteouſneſſe, and to reſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye vpon Chriſt Ieſus alone for our iuſtification and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is quite contrarie to our naturall diſpoſition: but it were a miracle of miracles that all theſe things ſhould be wrought in vs by ſickneſſe, which the Lord hath not orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for this purpoſe, when as the meanes appointed by God himſelfe the miniſterie of his word, which is Gods owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance could neuer worke them in vs. It may bee indeed that Gods hand lying heauy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs in the time of ſickneſſe, and fearing worſe iudgements in the life to come, we may be moued hereby to make a goodly ſhew, and to vowe great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation if we might bee reſtored to our health: It may be that with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> we may make a fained confeſſion of our ſinnes, and promiſe to amend if this iudgement may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:23802:211"/>or that we may with <hi>Achab</hi> outwardly humble our ſelues before God, to the end we may eſcape thoſe fearefull puniſhments which are threatned in his word; but it is a thouſand to one if we then truly repent who haue liued our whole time in impenitency, or then turne vnto God if wee were not before that time effectually called and conuerted; for as wee liue ſo wee commonly die, neither is it likely that hauing led our liues like wicked <hi>Balaam</hi> we ſhould die the death of the righteous, that hauing alwaies hitherto been thornes and thiſtles we ſhould now bring forth ſweet figges and pleaſant grapes when wee are ready to be cut downe and to be caſt into the fire, that hauing all our life ſowed the ſeedes of wickedneſſe we ſhould at our death reape the fruit of godlineſſe; <hi>And therefore</hi> (as the Apoſtle exhorteth) <hi>let vs not be deceiued: God is not mocked; for whatſoeuer a man ſoweth that ſhall he alſo reape; for he that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reape corruption, but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirite reape life euerlaſting.</hi> as it is Gal. 6.7.8.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt let remoued.</note>I anſwere firſt, that though al this were certaine, true, and not to bee doubted of, yet it is a moſt vnthankefull part and horrible ingratitude againſt our gracious God and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing father to take occaſion of his mercie the more to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, as before I haue ſhewed. Secondly I anſwere, that as God hath ſhewed his mercy in the gratious promiſes of the Goſpell, ſo alſo he hath as plainely declared his iuſtice in the ſeuere threatnings of the law, and he is as true in the one as in the other: And therefore all the queſtion is who ſhal taſt of his mercy, and who of his iuſtice, ſeing that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſome, and this threatned againſt others; or rather in truth it is without all queſtion, for the Lord hath plainely ſhewed in his word that hee will extend his mercy to all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinners and to them onely, and that he will declare his iuſtice in powring out his iuſt iudgements vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked who liue in their ſinnes, and eſpecially vpon thoſe who take occaſion of Gods mercie to continue in their vnrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:23802:212"/>deſpiſing the riches of his bountifulnes, his patience &amp; long ſuffering; for hereby they heape vnto themſelues <hi>wrath againſt the day of wrath and the declaration of the iuſt iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Rom. 2.4.5. Though then there be neuer ſo many ſweet promiſes in the goſpel, yet they who continue in their ſinnes without repentance can reape no true comfort by them, becauſe they are not made to them but to repentant ſinners; and on the other ſide though there be neuer ſo many terrible threatnings denounced in the law, yet the paenitent ſinner need not to feare them, ſeeing they are threatned onely againſt thoſe who continue in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paenitencie; though God be of infinit mercy let not the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man who liueth in his ſinnes preſume, ſeeing it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared in pardoning the ſinnes of repentant ſinners. Neither let him who is truly paenitent deſpaire becauſe God is of infinite iuſtice, ſeeing it is ſufficiently manifeſted in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the ſinnes of thoſe who continue in their vnrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie; let not him who is turned vnto God from his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked waies feare Gods iuſtice, for it is fully ſatisfied in Chriſt and therefore it ſhall neuer attach him, neither let him who continueth in his ſinnes without repentance hope in Gods mercy for it doth not belong vnto him, nor yet in the ſweet promiſes of the Goſpell which though they be neuer ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, yet are they alwaies to be reſtrained to the condition of the couenant of grace, faith, and repentance. And this is manifeſt in the places before alleaged which worldly men ſo much abuſe to nouriſh in them carnall ſecuritie; for whereas the Lord ſaith Ezech. 33.11. <hi>That he will not the death of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> he addeth in the next wordes, <hi>but that he turne from his way and liue,</hi> ſo that the Lord ſpeaketh not of all ſinners but of thoſe who turne vnto him from their wicked waies. So our ſauiour Chriſt ſaith Math. 9.13, that <hi>hee came not to call the righteous,</hi> that is thoſe who are iuſt &amp; righteous in their owne conceipts, <hi>but ſinners to repentance,</hi> ſo that whoſoeuer are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto Chriſt that in him they may haue ſaluation are called alſo to repentance. And Math. 11.28. our ſauiour doth not call all ſinners vnto him without difference, but thoſe
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:23802:212"/>onely who <hi>are wearie and heauy laden,</hi> that is who find their ſinnes irkſome and grieuous vnto them, and deſire nothing more then to be freed of this vnſupportable burthen. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> likewiſe 1. Tim. 2.4. doth not ſay ſimply that God would haue all men to beſaued, but that he would alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Let therefore no carnall ſecure man take occaſion to preſume vpon Gods mercy in regard of the ſweet and gratious promiſes of the Goſpell, for vnleſſe they turne vnto God from their euill waies and truely repent them of their ſinnes, vnleſſe they are wearie and heauie laden, deſiring nothing more then to be eaſed of their heauie burthen; vnleſſe they come out of their blind ignorance and attaine to the knowledge of the truth, the gratious promiſes of the Goſpell do not appertaine vnto them.</p>

It is true indeed that if with this thiefe we truelyturne vnto the Lord by vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſhew our faith by the like liuely fruites he wil par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our ſinnes and receaue vs to mercy according to his gratious promiſes, but this faith and repentance are not in our owne power, but the free gifts of God which hee very ſeldome beſtoweth on thoſe at the hower of death who haue neglected &amp; contemned them their whole liues: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indeed hee calleth and conuerteth ſome at the laſt hower to ſhew the infinite riches of his mercy, but moſt commonly he leaueth thoſe who haue deferred their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to die in their impaenitencie that they may be exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his iuſtice. And to this purpoſe <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeaketh
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:23802:213"/>well; there is (ſaith hee) mention made in the Scriptures of one whome the Lord receaued to mercy that none might deſpaire, and but of one that none might preſume. It is the maner of princes to ſend their gratious pardon ſometimes to thoſe who are led out to execution, but if any will wilfully offend in hope hereof, or hauing offended wil deferre to ſue for his pardon to the laſt hower, ſurely he is well worthy to be hanged, both for his offence; and alſo for his preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo the Lord mercifully pardoneth ſome few when death is ready to ceaſe vpon them, and to tranſport them into the eternall torments of hell fire, to ſhew the riches of his grace, but if any ſhall take occaſion hereby the more to offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his maieſtie, or hauing offended deferreth to ſue for pardon by powring out the teares of vnfained repentance vntill his laſt hower, hee is vndoubtedly vnworthy of any grace and mercy, and in all likelihood he ſhall be deliuered vp to ſuffer eternal torments. Moreouer as this act of mercy in receiuing this thiefe to grace was very extraordinary, ſo was it reſerued as being moſt fit for the time of Chriſtes paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for as great Princes at the time of their coronation par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſuch notorious offences, the like whereof they wil hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euer after remit, to the end that their clemencie and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy may appeare to all, ſo our Sauiour Chriſt the glorious king of heauen and earth, being ready to lay downe the forme of a ſeruant and to take vpon him the crowne of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe glory and maieſty, gaue his gratious pardon to this greeuous offender, that his infinite mercy and goodneſſe might be manifeſted vnto al men, that ſo they might breake of their ſinnes by vnfained repentance, and by a liuely faith come vnto him, looking and expecting for life and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely in this their ſauiour and redeemer; and as cunning Surgeons hauing made a ſoueraigne ſalue, do vpon the next occaſion make experiment thereof by curing ſome grieſly and deſperate wound, that ſo they may commend it to all who ſhal haue need to vſe it, ſo the Lord hauing made a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious plaiſter and ſoueraigne ſalue to cure all ſoules; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded with ſinne, will apply it vnto them by a liuely
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:23802:213"/>faith, preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly tooke occaſion of curing there with this poore theefe grieuouſly wounded with ſinne, that all others in his ſtate, ſeing the vertue thereof, might more earneſtly deſire it and more carefully ſeeke after, and apply it to their woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſoules. And therefore ſeeing the occaſion of this cure was altogether extraordinary, the action is not like to bee ordinarie, the occaſion being remooued, and the mercy of God and vertue of Chriſtes death and bloodſhed being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently manifeſted to al the world. Thirdly, we are to know that the eſtate of theſe men, is farre vnlike and much more deſperate then the ſtate of the conuerted theefe; for hee was in all likelihood neuer before this time called, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he harkeneth vnto the voyce of Chriſt, and willingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaineth the good motions of his ſpirit, but theſe men being often called, haue refuſed to come, and haue quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the good motions of Gods ſpirit; he perſiſted in his ſin ignorantly, hauing not heard the doctrine of the Goſpell, whereby he might be inuited to come vnto Chriſt by a liuely faith, and might turne vnto God by vnfained repentance, theſe haue often heard theſe glad tidings, and haue neglected and contemned them; hee continued in his ſinnes through ignorance, neither did hee vngratefully reſolue to ſerue the diuell his whole life, reſeruing the time of his old age and ſickneſſe for the ſeruice of God, only for his own aduantage, but theſe men hauing bin ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inſtructed in the law of God, and wayes of godlineſſe, notwithſtanding wittingly and wil fully perſiſt in their ſinns, preſuming vppon repentance and hope of mercy at the laſt houre, intending then to turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, not for any loue they beare him, but for feare of hel torments and eternall damnation, laſtly his repentance was moſt vnfayned and exceeding earneſt, and his faith brightly ſhined preſently after his conuerſion in ſingular fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For he made a notable confeſſion of his ſauiour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, euen when all his diſciples for feare forſooke him. He iuſtifieth Chriſt when all men condemned him, and euen his Apoſtles doubted of him. He praieth feruently vnto him, when the multitude mocked and reuiled him, hee humbly
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:23802:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>confeſſeth his owne ſinns, and louingly admoniſheth his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of his wickedneſſe, deſiring earneſtly that as they had bin fellowes, and copartners in ſinne, ſo they might be partakers in pardon, and in the benefitte of redemption wrought by Chriſt. Whereas moſt commonly their repentance is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and diſſembled for feare of puniſhment, rather then for hatred of ſinne, or loue of God: as they vſually make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt if they recouer of their ſickeneſſe. And therefore ſeing there is ſuch great diſſimilitude; and difference in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, liues, and courſes, it is not probable that they wil euer bee like in their conuerſion, death, and ſaluation.</p>

And firſt, when as he perceiueth that he can no longer blind them with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, nor keepe them ſtill in carnall worldineſſe &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſecuritie, when as he ſeeth that they are reſolued no longer to deferre their repentance and comming vnto Chriſt by a true faith, neither can be perſwaded to content themſelues, with ſuch faith and repentance as are falſe and counterfait; then, and not before he appeareth in his owne likeneſſe, and ſheweth himſelfe a diuell indeed; for then he
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:23802:221"/>accuſeth them of their manifold and outragious ſins, where in they haue long continued, then he telleth them of their ſinnes paſt and preſent corruptions, whereby they are readie to fall into the like againe, then hee reuealeth vnto them their ſinnes of ignorance, and calleth to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thoſe ſinnes which they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againſt their knowledge and conſcience, then will hee aggrauate their ſinnes which in themſelues are but too too hainous, and ſet before them the iuſtice of God, the fearefull threatnings and terrible curſe of the law, the wrath of God and the intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eternall torments of hell fire, which by their ſinnes they haue iuſtly deſerued; all which terrblie ſights being in one view repreſented to their already timorous thoughts, he taketh occaſion of them al, to moue them to diſtruſt of Gods mercies and Chriſtes merites, and ſo to plunge them into vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſperation. Wouldeſt thou now vile wretch (will hee ſay) turne vnto God hoping to bee receaued to grace and mercy? why aſſure thy ſelfe it is too late, for are not thy ſins in number numberleſſe, and in their qualitie and nature moſt haynous and outragious; and haſt thou not continued in this thy rebellion againſt God a long time, refuſing to come vnto him though he hath often called, and careleſſy neglecting all the meanes of thy ſaluation, when thy God hath gratiouſly offered them vnto thee? Now therefore the acceptable time and day of ſaluation is paſt neuer againe to be recalled, and though with <hi>Eſau</hi> thou ſeekeſt repentance with teares yet ſhalt thou neuer find it. Moreouer to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thy horrible rebellion adde the remembrance of Gods iuſtice, which can in no wiſe ſuffer ſinne to goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, the terrible curſe of the law denounced by God who is trueth it ſelfe, againſt thoſe who continue not in all that is written in the booke of the law to doe it, the fearefull torments of hell prepared for ſinners amongſt which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thou art one of the chiefe; and therefore doe not flatter thy ſelfe with hope of mercy, but rather expect thoſe feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iudgements and endleſſe torments which are due vnto thee for thy rebellious wickedneſſe: and thus doth Sathan
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:23802:221"/>labour to bring the poore Chriſtian to deepe deſperation, and to fill his conſcience with horrour and feare, which if he can accompliſh he reſteth not there, but like a cruell coward who can neuer be at quiet till he ſee the death of his enemie, ſo our malitious enemie is neuer ſatisfied till he ſee our death and vtter deſtruction. And therfore when he hath grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vexed the Chriſtians conſciences with fearefull horrour, and tormented him euen with the flaſhings of hell fire, in the next place he will perſwade him to ſeeke ſome eaſe of his preſent torments by imbruing his hands in his owne bloud, and putting himſelfe to ſome violent death: which is nothing els but (as the Prouerb is) to leape out of the frying pan into the fire, and in ſeeking to eaſe his terrours of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to plunge himſelfe into the torments of hell.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument drawne from Gods mercy.</note>The firſt argument, to aſſure all of the pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of their ſinnes, who will come vnto him, may be drawne from his mercy, which is one of his properties and attributes, ſo often attributed vnto him in the ſcriptures. Exod. 34.6.7. God thus deſcribeth himſelfe: <hi>The Lord, the Lord, ſtrong, mercifull and gracious, ſlow to anger, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in goodneſſe &amp; truth. 2 reſeruing mercy for thouſands,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:23802:222"/>forgiuing iniquitie, tranſgreſſion and ſinne.</hi> Out of which place that famous &amp; godly learned man <hi>H.

                  </note> &amp; therefore it ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe to ſet downe his owne words: <hi>For beſides</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the eſſence of God is only one, &amp; that eternal moſt ſimple moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, liuing, immortall, inuiſible, incorruptible, infinite, omnipotent, moſt wiſe; he is alſo wholy moſt good in whom nothing is wanting; a louer of men, most meeke, moſt gentle, ſlow to anger, moſt ready to forgiue iniuries, moſt patient, moſt true, moſt righteous, moſt iuſt, moſt faithfull in performing his promiſes, finally hee is nothing els then the ſoueraigne goodneſſe, and the chiefe clemencie as he hath deſcribed, and liuely deciphered himſelfe.</hi> Exod. 34. <hi>and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. And therefore we muſt note, although anger be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto God, yet notwithſtanding it is in God nothing els but the chiefe goodneſſe and iuſtice, whereby he abhorreth euill and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his iuſt iudgement doth at length puniſh it, if it be not amended by his long ſuffering and patience. This herehence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appeareth, becauſe ſpeaking of reuenge or taking puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is an effect of anger, he doth not ſay that he doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently inflict puniſhment, or that hee is ſo ready to inflict it as to ſhew mercy, but hee ſaith that hee is ſlow to anger. Sign fying by this maner of ſpeach, that he is of his owne nature alwayes moſt ready, to ſhew mercy, to graunt pardon, to be beneficiall; but not ſo ready to take puniſhment, but is forced here vnto as of himſelfe, vnwilling through our impenitencie. Hereunto alſo appertaineth that ancient forme of prayer; O Lord whoſe propertie is alwaies to haue mercy and forgiue.<note place="margin">Eſa. 28.21. 2. Sam. 5. 1. Chro. 14. Ioſ. 10.</note> Herehence alſo we read in</hi> Eſai. ch. 28.21. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſtand as in mount Perazim, hee ſhalbe angry as in the valley Gibeon. That he may doe his worke, his ſtrange worke, that he may effect his act, his ſtrange act. (that is, he ſhall inflict the like puniſhments in his iuſt anger vpon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious people, which hee exerciſed vpon his wicked enemies the Philiſtines in mount Perazim, when as he ouerthrewe them, by his ſeruant</hi> Dauid, <hi>and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the</hi> Amorites <hi>in the valley of Gibeon when as he ſmote them with ſtones from heauen.) Where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet maketh a twofold kind of Gods workes, his proper and ſtrange works. The proper worke of God is to ſhew mercy, and to ſpare or
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:23802:223"/>forgiue; his ſtrange worke is to be angry and to puniſh. And therefore whereas hee calleth that the proper worke of God, and this his ſtrange worke; he plainely teacheth that mercy, goodneſſe &amp; long ſuffering are according to the nature of the deitie, but that to be angry is diuers from Gods nature, Yea which is more hee maketh it not his worke, that is to ſay, he is angrie that afterwards he may bring his worke to paſſe, that is, that he may haue mercie and preſerue; for whileſt (ſaith the Apostle) wee are iudged of the Lord, we are chaſtened that we ſhould not be comdemned with the world.</hi> 1. Cor. 11.32. <hi>And what doe theſe things teach vs, but that the nature of God is nothing els then goodneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.32.</note> 
                  <hi>mercy, loue eſpecially of men, patience, benignitie, and moſt farre and remote from all vniuſt ſeueritie, cruelty, tyrannie, and pride.</hi> The which may miniſter vnto euery penitent ſinner moſt ſweet conſolation; for when they ſee that God is angry by reaſon of their ſins, &amp; that he doth greeuouſly afflict them, &amp; euen bring them as it were to the gates of hell, this muſt not make the to caſt of al hope &amp; to fal into vtter deſperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but they muſt remember, that theſe are not the Lords proper works but ſtrange vnto him, which he doth to this end, that he may bring to paſſe his owne proper works which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his nature, that is, that he may againe ſhew vnto vs the glorious beames of his louing cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance in more full brightneſſe, &amp; bring vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affliction to ioy, from the gates of hell to the kingdome of heauen. According to that 1. Sam. 2.6. the Lord killeth, &amp; maketh aliue, he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth downe vnto hell, and bringeth vp againe. As therefore when we ſee carpenters pulling downe a ruinous building our minds do not reſt there, becauſe we know that this they doe is not their proper worke, but we goe further in our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation thinking of a new houſe which they will build in the place of the old, for aſ much as wee know that it is not their proper worke to race downe but to build, or to race downe that they may build; ſo when wee ſee the Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and inflicting corrections let vs not reſt here, but with the like foreſight of mind, let vs conſider that he doth theſe his ſtrange and improper works, that afterwards he may do
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:23802:223"/>thoſe which are proper and naturall, that is that he afflicteth that he may bring the more true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, that he bringeth vs to the gates of hell, to the end hee may rayſe vs vp to bee partakers of the ioyes of heauen. But let vs conſider of ſome more teſtimonies of Gods infinite mercies. As the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> likewiſe ſaith Pſalm. 103.8. <hi>that the Lord is full of compaſſion and mercy, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſſe.</hi> and Pſal. 86.5 <hi>Thou Lord art good and mercifull, and of great kindneſſe vnto all them that call vpon thee.</hi> So the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ioel 2.13. teſtifieth of the Lorde, that hee is <hi>gratious and mercifull, ſlow to anger and of great kindneſſe.</hi> And the apoſtle ſaith that he is <hi>rich in mercie.</hi> Eph. 2.4. and 2.

Now wee know that naturall actions are not troubleſome, norirkſome, neither is the ſunne troubled with giuing lighte, nor the fire with giuing heate, nor the tree with yeelding fruite, nor the beaſt with nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing his young, nor man with receiuing nouriſhment, and ſleepe, becauſe it is their nature to be excerciſed in theſe actions, and therefore ſeeing mercie is of Gods eſſence, it is not painefull and troubleſome to excerciſe it towardes all repentant ſinners, bee their ſinnes neuer ſo many, and hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, no more, then it is troubleſome to exerciſe his iuſtice, in puniſhing of thoſe who are obſtinate and rebellious, nay it is not onely not troubleſome and painefull, but alſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightfull for God to ſhewe mercie vnto all thoſe who truely turne vnto him, and contrariwiſe it ſhould bee troubleſome and irkſome, (if I may ſo ſpeake,) for God not to ſhew and exerciſe his nature, and mercie, towardes repentant ſinners; for as the eye is delighed with ſeeing, and to bee reſtrayned there from is grieuous vnto it, as the care is delighed with hearing, and is much moleſted if it be ſtoped,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:23802:224"/>and as euerie part, and facultie of the bodie, and ſoule, are delighted in excerciſing their ſeuerall actions, and functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and are much vexed, and cumbred, if by any meanes they ſhould bee hindred; ſo is the Lord delighted, and well pleaſed, in ſhewing, and excerciſing his owne nature, and attributes, as his power, and prouidence, in gouerning the world, his iuſtice, in puniſhing wicked, obſtinate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſinners, and his mercy in pardoning, and remitting the ſinnes of thoſe, who are of an humble ſpirite and broken heart, and are wearie of this intollerable burthen, deſiring nothing more, then to bee eaſed and freed from it. And not to thus excerciſe his nature, and attributes, woulde ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (that I may ſpeake after the manner of men) bee vnto the Lord tedious and troubleſome.</p>
               <p>Of this pleaſure and delight, which the Lorde taketh in pardoning repentant ſinners, the Prophet Micha ſpeaketh, chap. 7.10.18. <hi>who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a God like vnto thee; that taketh away iniquitie, and paſſeth by tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage: he retaineth not his wrath for euer, becauſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie pleaſeth him.</hi> So the prophet Dauid Pſal. 147.11. ſaith that the <hi>Lord is delighted in them that feare him and attend vpon his mercy; euen as though he reioyced much,</hi> to haue an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offered, of excerciſing his mercy and goodneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes thoſe, who earneſtly deſiring it, wait vpon him, that they may bee made partakers of of it. For the obiect of Gods mercy, about which it is exerciſed, is mans miſerie, and the action thereof, is to pittie, and helpe him, out of his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and miſerable eſtate; and therefore, if there were no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, and wretchedneſſe, and no ſinne to be forgiuen, there would be wanting that external obiect, about which Gods mercy ſhould be exerciſed and manifeſted to all the world. And hence it is, that the Lorde willingly permitted the fall of our firſt parentes, to the ende that hee might make a way for the manifeſtation of his mercie, in pardoning repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſinners, and his iuſtice in puniſhing the contemners of his grace. And as the apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 11.32. <hi>God hath ſhut vp all in vnbeleefe, that hee might haue mercie on all,</hi> that
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:23802:224"/>is to ſay, on all the elect, both Iewes, and Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Seeing therfore God delighteth himſelfe in excerciſing &amp; manifeſting his mercy, to the praiſe of the glorie of his grace, by pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ing &amp; forgiuing repentant ſinners, let not any who are grieuouſly laden, &amp; grone for wearines vnder the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie burthen of their ſinnes, feare to come vnto the Lorde, and to implore his mercy for the forgiuenes of their ſinnes, though neuer ſo grieuous and manifould, neither let them doubt, leaſt God will reiect their ſuite, and refuſe to receiue them, into his grace, and fauoure, becauſe of their great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions and vnworthineſſe. For although there were not (as in truth there is not) any thing to bee reſpected in vs, ſauing that wee are the creatures of God, and worke of his handes, yet the Lorde will haue compaſſion vpon vs, euen for his owne ſake becauſe hee is exceedingly delighted in ſhewing mercy to all thoſe who turne vnto him. And this the Lord himſelfe profeſſeth Eſa. 43.25. <hi>I euen I am he that putteth away thine iniquities for mine owne ſake, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy ſinnes.</hi> And therefore the prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> calling vpon the Lord for mercy, in the behalfe of himſelfe and the people, diſclaimeth their owne righteouſneſſe, and all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their owne merits and worthineſſe; ſaying, wee do not preſent our ſupplications before thee for our own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, but for thy great tender mercies: <hi>O Lord heare, O Lord forgiue, O Lord conſider and doe it; deferre not for thine owne ſake.</hi> Dan. 9.18.19.</p>

For anſwering of which tentation, we are to know that though our ſinnes bee neuer ſo innumerable and hainous, yet this ſhould not diſcourage vs from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to God by vnfained repentance, with aſſured hope of forgiueneſſe, for though our ſinnes be great, his mercies are infinite, and conſequently though it were imagined that
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:23802:225"/>all the ſinnes which were euer committed in the world were ioyned together, yet in compariſon of Gods mercy they are without all compariſon leſſe then a mote in the Sunne to all the world. Neither is God like vnto man, whoſe bounty &amp; mercy are limited in ſome ſtraight bounds which they will not paſſe, and therefore they are ſoone weary both in giuing to thoſe who want, and forgiuing thoſe that offend, but his bounty is endleſſe and his mercies infinite, and therefore he can and wil as eaſily forgiue vs the debt of ten thouſand mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of pounds as one pennie, and as ſoone pardon the ſinns of a wicked <hi>Manaſſes</hi> as of a righteous <hi>Abraham,</hi> if we come vnto him by vnfained repentance, and earneſtly deſire and implore his grace and mercy.

If a Prince ſhould ſend his generall pardon vnto a number of offendors, without any exception or limitation, and one amongſt the reſt ſhould ſay this pardon doth not appertaine vnto me, becauſe I am ſo great an offender, and therefore I will ſtill ſtand in doubt of my Princes mercy, and ſuſpect his word, who would not accuſe ſuch an one both of folly in refuſing his pardon, and of vngratefulnes and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in diſtruſting his gratious Prince, calling his great mercy and truth in his promiſſe into queſtion? Who would not thinke this offence greater then all the reſt, but the Lord who is infinite in mercy, hath ſent his generall pardon to all repentant and beleeuing ſinners without all exception; why therefore ſhould wee make queſtion of his mercy, becauſe of our hamous ſinnes, why ſhould we vnto our others ſinnes
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:23802:225"/>adde this which is more hainous then all the reſt, indoubting and diſtruſting his word and promiſe, and in extenuating his infinite and endleſſe mercies. For if wee thinke our debt ſo great that God will neuer forgiue it, what doe we els but detract from Gods rich bounty and liberality, if we ſuppoſe our ſinnes may not bee for giuen becauſe of their greatneſſe, what do we els but imagine that they ſurpaſſe Gods infinite mercy, which is a moſt horrible blaſphemy once to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</p>

Now that our ſauiour Chriſt hath ſufficiently ſuffered for all the ſinnes of the faithfull; it is euident by many places of the Scriptures.

<pb n="435" facs="tcp:23802:227"/>ſinnes that are paſſed through the patience of God.</hi> 26. <hi>to ſhewe at this time his righteouſneſſe that hee might be iust, and a iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of him who is of the faith of Ieſus,</hi> So it is ſaid 1.

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:23802:228"/>our ſtead an ignominious death, whereas we deſerued the anger of God, and to bee kept priſoners in the graue vnder the dominion of death, he endured his fathers wrathfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and himſelfe was for a time held captiue of death in the graue, that ſo he might reconcile vs to his father and ſet vs at libertie. In a word whatſoeuer we owed Chriſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, whatſoeuer wee deſerued hee ſuffered, if not in the ſelfe ſame puniſhments, (for hee could not ſuffer the eternall torments of hell) yet in proportion, the dignity of his perſon giuing value vnto his temporarie puniſhments, and making them of more valew and worth then if all the world ſhould haue ſuffered the eternal torments of hell. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore our Sauiour Chriſt hath fully diſcharged our debt and made full ſatisfaction to his fathers iuſtice, God cannot in equitie exact of vs a ſecond payment, no more then the creditours may iuſtly require that his debt ſhould be twice payd, once of the ſuerty, and againe of the principal. Neither now hath Gods iuſtice any thing to ſhew againſt vs, for the lawe which was the hand writing of ordinances which made againſt vs, and as it were a bond whereby wee were obliged and bound to God the father either to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme obedience, or to vndergoe the penaltie; euen euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting death and condemnation, is now cancelled taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; <hi>and faſtened to the croſſe</hi> of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.

The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> who had in himſelfe often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Gods mercy telleth vs, Pſal. 32.10. that <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer truſteth in the Lords mercy ſhall compaſſe him.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay</hi> exhorteth the wicked <hi>to forſake his wayes, and the vnrighteous his owne imaginations, and to returne vnto the Lord, aſſuring them that he will haue mercy vpon them, for he is very ready to forgiue.</hi> Eſay. 55.7. The Lord himſelfe alſo doth make this gratious promiſe Ezech. 18.21. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if the wicked will returne from all his ſinnes which he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and keepe all my Statutes, and doe that which is lawfull and right, he ſhall ſurely liue and not dye.</hi> 22. <hi>All his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed ſhall not bee mentioned vnto him, but in his righteouſneſſe that he hath done he ſhall liue.</hi> 23. <hi>Haue I any deſire that the wicked ſhould dye ſaith the Lord God? or ſhall he not liue if he returne from his wayes?</hi> verſ. 32. <hi>For I deſire not the death of him that dieth ſaith the Lord God; cauſe therefore one another to returne and liue yee,</hi> and cap. 33. ver. 11. <hi>As I liue ſaith the Lord I deſire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turne from his way and liue.</hi> So Mal. 3.17. the Lord profeſſeth that hee <hi>will ſpare his people and children, as a man ſpareth his owne Sonne that ſerueth him.</hi> Now we know that a louing father is ready to forgiue, &amp; to receaue into his grace
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:23802:230"/>and fauour his repentant Sonne, though he hath very often offended him: &amp; ſo ſurely the Lord who is infinitely rich in mercy, wil much more forgiue his children when they turne vnto him; nay he is not onely ready to receaue them into his grace and fauour, but it filleth him (as I may ſay) with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ioy and delight, when his repentant children for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their ſinnes and euill wayes, and turne vnto him by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained repentance, as it appeareth moſt euidently in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the prodigall Sonne, of the ſtrayed ſheepe, and the loſt groat. Moreouer our Sauiour Chriſt had his name <hi>Ieſus</hi> giuen him of God by the miniſter of an Angell, becauſe hee ſaueth his people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſinnes: as appeareth Math. 1.21. &amp; he therfore came into the world, not to cal the righteous but ſinners to repentance. As it is Matt. 9.13. and he inuiteth and calleth vnto him all thoſe who are wearie and heauie laden with the burthen of their ſinnes, promiſing that hee will eaſe them. Matt 11.28. yea ſo certaine it is that they ſhal haue remiſſion of their ſinnes and euerlaſting hapineſſe who truly repent and beleeue, that our ſauiour Chriſt ſaith they haue it already as though they were in preſent poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Iohn 5.24. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay vnto you, he that heareth my word and beleeueth in him that ſent me, hath euerlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation but hath paſſed from death to life.</hi> So chap. 6.47. and chap. 11.26. <hi>whoſoeuer liueth and beleeueth in mee ſhall neuer die.</hi> The apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alſo plainly affirmeth that <hi>God would haue no man to periſh, but would haue all men to come to repentance.</hi> Seeing therefore the Lord hath made ſo many gratious promiſes in the Goſpel to all repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and beleeuing ſinners, let vs vnfainedly turne vnto the Lord, and apply Chriſt and his meritts vnto vs by a true &amp; liuely faith, and then we may aſſure our ſelues that he will pardon and forgiue vs al our ſinnes, and receaue vs gratiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into his loue and fauour.</p>

<pb n="442" facs="tcp:23802:231"/>haue moſt iuſtly deſerued that God ſhould poure out vppon them the violls of his wrath, and thoſe fearefull puniſhments threatned in the law, becauſe of the innumerable number of their ſinnes and the outragiouſneſſe of their wickedneſſe; and therefore ſuch haue nothing to doe with the ſweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes of the Goſpell, but are to apply vnto themſelues the terrible threatnings denounced in the law againſt ſuch grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinners.</p>
               <p>For the anſwering of which tentation, wee are to know that the Lords promiſes made in the Goſpell, are general, indefinite and vniuerſall, excluding none, who turne from their ſinnes by vnfained repentance, and beleeue in Chriſt Ieſus, reſting on him alone for their ſaluation. Neither is there any limitation or exception of this or that ſinne, for be they neuer ſo greiuous and manifold, yet if wee performe the condition of faith and repentance, the Lord will make good his promiſes vnto vs.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, namely that the promiſes of the goſpell are indefinite, and generally made to al who repent and beleeue it, ſhall manifeſtly appeare if wee conſider the particulars. Eſa. 55.1. the Lord calleth all vnto him indefinitly, ſaying, <hi>to euery one who thirſteth come to the waters, and yee that haue no ſiluer come, buy and eate; Come I ſay buy wine and milke with out ſiluer and without money;</hi> ſo that though we haue no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe and righteouſneſſe of our owne, yet if we thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the mercy of God and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and come vnto God by vnfained repentance, and vnto our ſauiour by a liuely faith, our thirſt ſhall be ſatiſfiyed and all our wantes ſupplyed. So Ezech. 33.11. the Lord ſolemnely ſweareth that hee <hi>will not the death of a ſinner, but that they turne from their wicked wayes and liue;</hi> where hee ſpeaketh not of this or that ſinner, but of all without exception who turne vnto him. Our ſauiour Chriſt likewiſe maketh this indefinite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Marke 16.16. that <hi>whoſoeuer ſhal beleeue and be baptiſed ſhalbe ſaued.</hi> and Iohn 3.14. he ſaith, <hi>that as Moſes lift vp the ſerpent in the wilderneſſe, ſo must the ſonne of man be lift vp</hi> 15. <hi>that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhould not periſh but haue
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:23802:231"/>eternal life.</hi> So that as al who were ſtunge of the fyrie ſerpent were healed if they looked vpon the braſen ſerpent, neither was their any exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> between thoſe who were deeply, or but a little pearſed with the ſting, for if they were ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g they died, if they vſed not the remedy ordained of God, though their wound were but ſmall and ſhallow, but if they looked vp to the braſen ſerpent according to God ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, they were cured though their wound were neuer ſo deadly and deſperate, ſo thoſe who looke not vpon Chriſt Ieſus hanging on the croſſe with the eye of faith, are ſure to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euerlaſting death and damnation, bee their ſinnes neuer ſo few, and on the other ſide, they who lay hould vpon Chriſt and beleeue in him, are ſure to bee ſaued though their ſins bee neuer ſo many and grieuous. So in the 16. verſe it is ſaid, that God ſo loued the world, that hee hath giuen his onely begotten ſonne, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhould not periſh but haue euerlaſting life. and ve. 36. He that beleeueth in the ſonne hath euerlaſting life. &amp;c. So that here is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of ſinnes, for the promiſes are made indefinitely to all that beleeue. In like maner our Sauiour hath promiſed Iohn 6.37. <hi>That whoſoeuer come vnto him hee will not caſt them away.</hi> and ve. 40. he aſſureth vs that it is <hi>the will of his father who ſent him, that euery man who beleeueth in him ſhould haue euerlasting life.</hi> And the Apoſtle Peter Actes 10.43. ſaith that <hi>vnto our Sauiour Chriſt giue all the prophets witneſſe, that through his name all that beleeue in him ſhall haue remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> And the Apoſtle Iohn likewiſe ſaith, 1. Ioh. 2.1. <hi>that if any man ſinne wee haue an aduocate with the father Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, and hee is the propitiation for our ſinnes, and not for ours onely but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole world,</hi> that is for whoſoeuer repent and beleeue of euery kingdome, countrey, and nation. So that by all theſe places it is cleare and euident that none are excluded from being partakers of Gods mercifull promiſes, but thoſe who exclude themſelues through their infidelitie and vnrepentancie.</p>

                  <hi>and to cleanſe vs from all vnrighteouſneſſe.</hi> So that here is no mention made of any ſinnes which are excepted, or which exclude vs from Gods mercy &amp; Chriſts merits, ſo that we repent &amp; beleeue; neither are the promiſes of the Goſpell limited or reſtrained in reſpect of the number or greeuouſneſſe of our ſinnes, ſo we performe the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith and repentance, for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is hartily ſorie for his ſinnes paſt, and purpoſeth for the time to come to leaue and forſake them, whoſoeuer doth beleeue Gods promiſes and reſteth vpon Chriſt Ieſus alone, for his ſaluation by a true and liuely faith, he may be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured, that the Lord hath pardoned and forgiuen all his ſinnes, and receaued him into his grace and fauour, though his ſinnes be neuer ſo many and hainous; and on the other ſide whoſoeuer continueth in his vnrepentancie and infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, ſhalbe condemned though his other ſinnes be neuer ſo few and ſmall; neither will all our other ſinnes debarre vs of Gods mercy, vnleſſe they bee ioyned with vnrepentancie and vnbeliefe, for obſerue the condition of the promiſes, faith and repentance, and all the promiſes of the Goſpell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto thee though thou were the greateſt ſinner that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer liued. For whereas it may be obiected that the ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Ghoſt is vnpardonable, we are to know it is not ſo much in regard of the hainouſneſſe of the ſinne, as that becauſe it is alwaies ſeuered and diſioyned from faith and repentance, God denying theſe his graces to thoſe who
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:23802:232"/>vpon deſperate malice haue made a generall Apoſtaſie, and haue perſecuted the knowne truth. So that if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to repent and beleeue, it were poſſible alſo that they ſhould be ſaued.</p>
               <p>Seing therefore the promiſes of the Goſpell are generall excluding none, let not any man who is laden with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of his ſinnes, exclude himſelfe through his want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and infidelitie, for though their other ſinnes are grieuous, yet this is more hainous and damnable then all the reſt.

Firſt God the father hath created vs of nothing, euen according to his own image, and when wee had defaced this his image in vs, and made our ſelues ſlaues to Sathan, he ſo tenderly loued vs his poore miſerable creatures, that he ſpared not his dearely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued &amp; onely begotten Sonne, but ſent him into the world to take our nature vpon him, that therein he might ſuffer all miſery and affliction, and laſtly the curſed and bitter death of the croſſe, that ſo he might ſatisfie his iuſtice for our ſinnes &amp; perfect the worke of our redemption. And this the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt witneſſeth, Iohn 3.16. Al which loue the Lord ſhewed
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:23802:233"/>vnto vs euen for his owne names ſake, when we neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued it nor yet deſired it, for we were bondſlaues vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and well contented to liue in his bondage, wee were children of wrath and dead in our ſinnes, yea wee were enemies vnto God and all goodneſſe. And therefore if our mercifull God ſo loued vs whileſt we were in loue with our ſinnes, at league with his enemie Sathan, &amp; at enmitie with him, that hee ſent his dearely beloued and onely begotten Sonne to dye for vs, that by his death and bloudſhed hee might redeeme and ſaue vs out of this miſerable eſtate, how much more will he now receiue vs to mercy and pardon, and forgiue our ſinnes if we ſeeke and ſue for grace? if hee loued vs ſo dearely when we hated him, and ſought al means of reconciliation when wee were profeſſed enemies againſt him, how much more will hee receaue vs into his fauour, when as we earneſtly deſire to be reconciled? If he ſo loued vs that he ſent his Sonne to die for our ſinnes, how much more will he remit thoſe ſinnes for which hee hath ſatisfied, when as with harty ſorrow we doe bewaile them, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire to be freed from them? if he hath giuen his Sonne to mankind to this end, that hee ſhould ſaue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme repentant ſinners, why ſhould any doubt of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and ſaluation if they turne vnto him by vnfained repentance, and lay hould on Chriſt by a liuely faith? and if he haue giuen vs his chiefe Iewell, hiw onely begotten and beſt beloued Sonne and that when wee were his enemies, what will he denie vs when in Chriſt we are reconciled vnto him and become his friends? And thus the Apoſtle reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, Rom. 5.8. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſetteth out his loue towards vs ſeeing that whileſt we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for vs.</hi> 9. <hi>much more then being now iuſtified by his bloud we ſhalbe ſaued from wrath through him.</hi> 10. <hi>For if we were enemies we were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by the death of his Sonne, much more being reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led we ſhalbe ſaued by his life.</hi>

Though then our ſinnes be many and grieuous, this ſhould not hinder vs from comming to Chriſt by a true faith, and firme aſſurance, that in him wee ſhall haue the remiſſion of our ſinnes, and be receaued into Gods loue and fauoure, nay rather this ſhould bee a forceible argument to mooue vs, to ſeeke his helpe, when wee find our ſelues in a deſperate caſe, deſtitute of all meanes whereby wee may attaine vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing our Sauiour Chriſt came into the world to ſaue ſuch as were loſt in themſelues, and inthralled in the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable bondage of ſinne and Sathan. And this is euident by the ſcriptures, Matth. 9.13. our Sauiour profeſſeth that <hi>he came not to call the righteous but ſinners to repentance.</hi> and Luke 19.10. <hi>The ſonne of man is come to ſeeke and to ſaue that which was loſt.</hi> 1.

               <p>Seeing therefore hee came into the world to ſaue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme grieuous and hainous ſinners, and to giue life vnto thoſe who were euen ſtarke dead in their ſinnes, ſeeing alſo hee calleth and inuiteth ſuch vnto him as are heauily laden with an intollerable waight of wickedneſſe, and promiſeth to eaſe them; let vs not excuſe our ſelues from comming becauſe our ſinnes are hainous and grieuous, but therefore let vs the rather goe vnto Chriſt becauſe wee had need of his helpe. If a man being loded with a waightie burthen, ſhould refuſe the helpe of a friend, both able and willing to eaſe him becauſe his burthen is very heauie, who would not laugh at ſuch ridiculous follie, for therefore he ſhould more

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That the price which Chriſt hath paid for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion farre exceedeth all our ſinnes.</note>Moreouer we need not to doubt of the ſufficiencie of the price which our Sauiour hath paid for our redemption, for it is of infinite value and of more vertue and power to iuſtifie and ſaue, then all the ſinnes of the world to condemne and deſtroye; ſo that though wee were the greateſt ſinners that euer liued, yea though the waight of all ſinne which euer in the world hath beene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted did lie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, yet the meritts of Chriſt and the price which hee paid for our redemption doe farre exceede them, and if we come vnto him by a liuely faith reſting vpon him alone for our ſaluation, hee will ſurely eaſe vs of this intollerable burthen.

Now what can

For ſeeing our Sauiour who ſo tenderly loued vs, that hee ſpared not to giue his owne moſt precious bloud for the price of our redemption hath all-ſufficient power in his owne handes to ſaue and deliuer vs out of the handes of all our enemies, who can imagine that hee will ſuffer vs to bee loſt whom he hath ſo dearely bought? ſeeing he gaue his life to purchaſe for vs the remiſſion of our ſinnes, who can doubt that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thus dearely purchaſed it hee will not beſtowe it and ſo ſuffer his bloud to be ſpilt in vaine, ſeeing he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for our ſakes to indure all miſerie, mockings, reuilings, whipping, crucifying death it ſelfe, &amp; the anger of his father more bitter then death, to this end that by all theſe his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, he might procure the remiſſion of our ſinnes &amp; euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and that when we were rebellious traitours who did flee away from him; who can make any queſtion, but that now hee will beſtow theſe ineſtimable benefits which he hath of purpoſe bought for vs, they being in his owne power and cuſtodie, if like humble ſeruants and penitent children we turne vnto him and implore his grace? if a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour had a deare friend who loued him ſo intirely, that he would not ſpare to giue his whole ſubſtance to procure his pardon, would this miſerable offendour feare death or condemnation, if he were aſſured that now his pardon were in his friends hand, and that the matter were by his Prince referred to him, as vnto a ſupreame iudge abſolutely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what hee will? But our Sauiour hath not giuen goods or gold, or any corruptible thing, but euen his owne moſt pretious body to be crucified, &amp; his bloud to be ſhed, that by this ineſtimable price he might purchaſe our pardon of God our ſoueraigne king, now he hath the law in his own hands, and is appointed of God for our ſupreame Iudge to acquit vs at his owne pleaſure, who therefore can make any doubt of grace and pardon, ſeeing his iudge is his Sauiour who hath loued him ſo dearely, that to this end he hath ſhed his precious bloud, that he might procure for him the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:23802:238"/>of his ſinnes and euerlaſting happineſſe, and therefore if he would not ſticke to buy it at ſo high a rate, how much more hauing bought it onely for this purpoſe will he now beſtow it if we ſeeke vnto him, and earneſtly deſire to bee partakers of his grace and mercy.</p>

But I ſhall not need to heape vp ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars, onely I can not paſſe that notable example of <hi>Manaſſes</hi> one of the moſt outragious ſinners and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſt wretch that euer liued, as the holy Ghoſt hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him in the 21.<note place="margin">2. Kings 21.</note> chap. of the 2. booke of the <hi>Kings.</hi> For there he affirmeth of him that he was a moſt horrible idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:23802:244"/>a moſt malitious enemy and cruell perſecuter of Gods truth, a defiler of Gods holy temple, a ſacrificer of his owne children vnto idols, that is diuels, a notable witch, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſorcerer, a bloudy murtherer of exceeding many the deare Saints and true Prophets of the Lord, one who did not runne headlong alone into all helliſh impietie, but alſo ledd the people vnder his gouerment out of the way to doe more wickedly then did the Heathen people whom the Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied before the children of Iſrael, and in a word wrought more abominations and outragious wickedneſſe then the curſed <hi>Amorites</hi> and <hi>Cananites,</hi> of whom notwithſtanding the land ſurfetted and ſpued them out for their crying ſins. And yet this <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> this wretch, more like a diuell incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate then a Saint of God, repenting him of his ſinnes from the bottome of his heart, was receaued (I cannot ſpeake it without rauiſhing wonder of Gods bottomleſſe &amp; neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently admired mercy) was receaued I ſay, to grace, and obtained the pardon of all his horrible ſinnes and moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable wickedneſſe. Now all theſe examples are written for our learning, and are recorded by the holy Ghoſt, to the end that wee may continually laud and prayſe the Lord for his endleſſe and infinite mercies, and gather vnto our ſelues aſſurance, that though our ſinnes were as grieuous and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous as any of theirs before named, yet if with them wee turne from our ſinnes by vnfained repentance, and goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt by a liuely faith, wee ſhall alſo with them receaue the pardon of our ſinnes, and be entertained into Gods loue and fauour.</p>

So farre forth therefore as wee are ſtill carnall and corrupt fleth the world loueth vs, but as much as is ſpirituall and regenerate ſo much the world hateth and abhorreth. Moreouer we may generally be conſidered as men, or more ſpecially as we are Chriſtian men; in the firſt reſpect, the world that is wicked worldlings may loue vs for ſome naturall partes or meere morall vertues, or els in common humanitie as members of the ſame ciuill or politicke body: but as wee are Chriſtians who haue giuen our names vnto God &amp; diuoted our ſelues to his worſhip and ſeruice, the world hateth vs and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, religion, and all the fruits and exerciſes of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and holineſſe, ſo that though in other naturall, worldly, and more ciuill reſpects it loueth vs, yet in regard of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and the fruites thereof it cannot indure vs, and our companie and conuerſation is exceeding tedious, irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and vnpleaſant.

               <p>Of this hardneſſe of heart which verie often befalleth the deareſt of Gods children wee haue many examples.<note place="margin">Examples of this hardneſſe of heart. <hi>Pſal. 77.2.</hi>

               <p>And hence it is that many of Gods children doe grieouſly afflict their ſoules becauſe they ſee theſe their corruptions and imperfections, and hereby often times are mooued to thinke that they are deſtitute of faith, and of all ſauing graces of Gods ſanctifying ſpirite, becauſe though they vſe the

Seuenthly after this aſſurance of Gods loue and of the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth firſt a true hatred of ſinne, becauſe it is ſinne, an vnfained ſorrow not ſo much in regarde of the puniſhment which by our ſinnes wee haue iuſtly deſerued, as that becauſe we haue offended our ſo gratious a God and tender louing father. Secondly this ſorrow will not ſuffer vs to hide, excuſe,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.11</note> or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:23802:263"/>our ſins,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>Thirdly being aſſured of the pardon of our ſinnes paſt, wee labour and ſtriue for the time to come to leaue and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, and to mortifie the fleſh and corruptions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of whereby we are led captiue vnto ſinne, &amp; alſo we indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with a feruent zeale of Gods glorie to ſerue the Lorde in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, that ſo by our godly liues wee may glorifie him and expreſſe our thankfulneſſe for all his ineſtimable benefites. Fourthly if at any time beſides or contrary to our purpoſe we be ouertaken by our corruption, and fall into ſinne, there followeth in vs an holy anger and indignation with our ſelues, becauſe wee did not more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looke to our waies; which godly anger preceedeth to the taking of a holy kind of reuenge, to the end that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our ſinnes may be ſubdued and our corruptions mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For example hee that hath offended through gluttonie and drunkenneſſe being truly penitent and angry with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for his ſinne, will alſo tame the fleſhe by puniſhing the ſame through faſting and abſtinence. He that hath offended by vſing exceſſiue pride in apparrell, being angrie with him ſelfe vpon his true repentance doth withdraw from himſelfe ſuch coſtly attire as otherwiſe in reſpect of his calling hee might lawfully weare.</p>

               <p>So in the time of winter the fruitfull trees are ſo nipped with the cold froſts, and ſo weatherbeaten with tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtormes that they appeare naked &amp; bare, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruite but alſo leaues, ſo as if wee ſhall iudge according to ſence &amp; outward appearance we ſhould falſely conclude that they are dead; for by experience we know that they liue and ſucke nouriſhment out of the earth, euen when they are moſt ſpoiled of their ſummer beautie, and though they are toſſed with the winds yet hereby they are not hurt but rather take deeper roote and ſo are made capeable of more nouriſhment, and though they bee nipped with cold froſts yet hereby they are not made barren nay rather hereby their wormes and cankers are killed, and they prepared and made fitt to bring forth more fruite in the time of ſommer, when the comfortable ſpring approacheth, and the ſweet ſhowers and warme ſunne beames fall and deſcend vpon them.

                  </note> wee are to conſider that deſperation it ſelfe is a moſt hainous and outragious ſinne, for it cauſeth men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Gods truth in his promiſes &amp; to account him a liar, as the Apoſtle plainely ſpeaketh, 1.

Now to denie the truth, mercy, and iuſtice of God is to denie God himſelfe, for his attributes are his eſſence, the truth of God is the true God, the mercy of God is the mercifull God, and the iuſtice of God is the iuſt God. So that he who deſpaireth falleth into the moſt horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and capitall ſinne of Atheiſme euen the higheſt degree of wickedneſſe, and therefore more hainouſly offendeth God by this ſinne alone, then by all his other ſins whatſoeuer, though they appeare neuer ſo monſtrous and abominable in his owne eies. For example the ſinne of <hi>Cain</hi> in deſpairing of Gods mercy, was far more horrible then his mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous ſinne which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in murthering his owne brother: the ſinne of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> in deſpairing of Gods mercy, was without compariſon greater then his ſinne in betraying his Lord and maiſter, in a word to commit Idolatrie, blaſphemy, murther, adultery, &amp;
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:23802:282"/>ſuch like are hainous ſinnes, but vtterly to deſpaire of Gods mercy is greater then they all. Though then wee haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted other horrible wickednes againſt the Lord, yet in no caſe let vs deſpaire, for this were to adde ſinne vnto ſinne, and to clogg our conſciences more with the laſt then with all the former, til with their intollerable waight they preſſe vs down vnto hell; you would count him worſe then madd who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppreſſed with a heauy burthen ſhould (in ſtead of vſing other meanes to eaſe himſelfe) adde thereunto a double or treble waight, till hee were preſſed downe groueling vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the earth; but aſſuredly ſuch and greater madneſſe it is when wee feele our conſciences clogged with a heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of ſinne, in ſtead of ſeeking eaſe in comming to Chriſt by a liuely faith, to fall into vtter deſperation and thereby to add a treble waight to the already intollerable burthen of ſinne, which lieth vpon our conſciences vntill they be preſſed down into the torments of hell. Euery one would eſteeme him a moſt deſperate wretch, who hauing offended ſuch a gratious Prince, as would moſt ſurely forgiue him vpon his vnfained ſorrow for his fault, ſhould in ſtead of humbling himſelfe and asking pardon deſperately refuſe his Princes mercy, and with all denie his truth in his promiſes his mercy, iuſtice, and euen diſauow him for being a lawfull Prince. But ſuch and much more wickedneſſe doe they deſperately commit who hauing offended God by their grieuous ſinnes, who is ſo gratious &amp; mercifull, that he would moſt certainely forgiue them vpon their true repentance, in ſtead of humbling themſelues by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained ſorrow, doe deſperately refuſe to bee partakers of his mercy, and not onely ſo but deny the infinitenes of his mercy; iuſtice, truth in his promiſſes, and conſequently his godhead and being. And therefore when (the waight of ſinne preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vs) Sathan perſwadeth vs to deſpaire of mercy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes, let vs in any caſe reſiſt this tentation, and boldly ſay vnto the tempter; it is inough and too much that I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended my gratious God with my other ſinnes, though I doe not ad thereunto this ſin which is greater then all the reſt, the waight of my other wickedneſſe is already too too heauy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The which tentation wee may eaſily anſwere if wee but remember that which already hath beene deliuered; namely that the beſt cannot attaine in this life vnto ſuch perfection of faith as is quite freed from all infirmities and corruption, that there is diuers degrees of true iuſtifying faith, ſome weaker, ſome ſtronger, ſome in greater, and ſome in ſmaller quantitie, ſome like ſmooking flaxe, and a graine of muſtard ſeed, &amp; ſome like a bright burning flame which giueth light, and the liuely heat of true comfort to thoſe who are indued therewith, and of as high growth as the greateſt tree in the garden, and yet all true faith and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicient for ſaluation.

               <p>Though therefore we finde in vs much inconſtancie and doubting, yet let not Sathan perſwade vs that theſe are of the nature and properties of our faith, and that therefore our faith is not true but temporarie falſe and counterfaite, for this inconſtancie and doubting, proceedeth not from faith and from the ſpirituall and regenerate part, but from the fleſh and the part vnregenerate; and therefore howſoeuer it is aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſometimes foyled by them, yet in it owne nature it is true certaine and conſtant.</p>

Laſtly, though it be euident that diuers of the Saints mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had a farre greater meaſure of faith, and brought foorth much more plentiful fruits then we can diſcerne in our ſelues, yet this is no good reaſon to prooue that our weaker &amp; ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler faith is no faith, or vneffectuall for our ſaluation, for this is an abſurd conſequence, the Moone giueth much leſſe light then the Sunne, therefore it giueth no light at all, one hand is farre greater then another, therefore the leſſer is not a true hand, this man excelleth another in the vſe of reaſon, and therefore the other is vnreaſonable, becauſe the diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the quantitie of things doe not take away the truth of their being and exiſtence ſo long as they be of the ſame nature and qualitie.

Euen the diſciples themſelues when they were reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for their little faith, were by him ſtrengthened and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſo that all the power of hell could not preuaile againſt it,
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:23802:291"/>and though Sathan indeauoured to ſift them as wheate, yet Chriſts interceſſion was more mightie to defend them, then the diuell to deſtroye them, and his interceſſion a ſtronger propp to vphould them, then the waight of Sathans tentations to ouerthrow and bring them to ruine; ſo he who cryed out I beleeue Lord helpe thou my vnbeliefe, though his faith was weak yet it periſhed not, but rather receiued a greater increaſe. Yea he reiected not <hi>Thomas</hi> in his wilfull doubting and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate incredulitie, but offered all occaſions of confirming his weake faith, and neuer ceaſed till hee had fully aſſured him of his reſurrection. In a word all the ſaintes of God at one time or other haue had experience of this mercy, power, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God in ſupporting their weakneſſe, vphoulding them in their great infirmities, and in rayſing them when they were fallen to the ground; and to this end our Sauiour was annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Gods ſpirite vnto the office of his mediation, that hee ſhould <hi>preach the goſpell vnto the poore, heale the broken harted, that he ſhould preach deliuerance vnto captiues, and recouerie of ſight to the blind, and ſet at libertie them that are bruſed.</hi> Luk. 4.18.<note place="margin">Luk. 4.18.</note> To this ende hee had familiar ſociety with the fraile and weake, with thoſe who had little faith, that he might increaſe it, and no faith, that he might begett it, with publicanes and ſinners and men full of infirmities; to this purpoſe he calleth ſuch as thirſt and hunger feeling their owne emptineſſe of grace, and earneſtly deſiring to bee filled and ſatisfied, and ſuch alſo as labour and are heauie laden with the vnſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble waight of their corruptions promiſing that hee will eaſe them, laſtly to this end he hath ordayned the miniſterie of the worde and adminiſtration of the ſacraments, not only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get faith where it is not, but to nouriſh and increaſe it where it is weake and feeble, and therefore though our faith be neuer ſo weake and ſmall let not Sathan perſwade vs that therefore it ſhall bee ouerthrowne and turned into infidelitie, for the Lord hath aſſured vs both by his gratious promiſes in his word and alſo by the performance thereof in his works from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to this day, that where hee hath giuen the leaſt meaſure of faith or any other ſanctifying grace, there he will

                  </note> The next ſubordinate cauſe and means of our ſaluation is our iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for <hi>whomſoeuer the Lord effectually calleth thoſe alſo he iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.</hi> as it is Rom. 8.30.

               <p>For the firſt. Iuſtification is an action orworke of the whole trinitie the father, ſonne, and holy ghoſt, whereby God gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly and freely imputing vnto euery faithfull man the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and obedience of Chriſt the mediatour doth accept of him and pronounce him to be iuſt and righteous, for the glorie of his name and ſaluation of the beleeuer.</p>
               <p>The efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſe of our iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is God alone as appeareth by manifeſt teſtimonies. Eſa. 43.25. <hi>I,</hi>

                  <hi>euen I am he that putteth away thine iniquities for my owne ſake and will not remember thy ſinnes.</hi> So Ezech. 16.8.

                  <hi>I clothed thee with broydred worke &amp;c.</hi> whereby he ſignifieth that he purged it with the bloud of Chriſt from all ſinne, and adorned it with the rich robe of his righteouſneſſe. The Apoſtle likewiſe ſaith that it is God who iuſtifieth him who in himſelfe was vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Rom. 4.5. and 8.33. <hi>It is God who iuſtifieth, who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne?</hi> The reaſon hereof is manifeſt becauſe it is the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom we haue ſinned, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh Pſal. 51.4. And he alone is our ſupreame iudge who hath authoritie to

               <p>And this worke is not peculiar vnto any one perſon, but is commune to the whole trinitie. For God the father being fully ſatisfied by the full ſatisfaction, righteouſneſſe, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt the ſonne, applied vnto vs by the holy ſpirit, doth pardon and forgiue vs all our ſinnes, and pronounceth and accepteth of vs as innocent, and indued with perfect righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>The motiue or impulſiue cauſe, which moued the Lorde thus to iuſtifie vs, was not any thinge in vs or out of him ſelfe; but of his meere mercy, and free good will wherewith hee hath loued vs from the beginning, as it manifeſtly appeareth Rom. 3.24.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.24.</note> Where the Apoſtle ſayth that <hi>we are iuſtified free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his grace, through the redemption that is in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> and Tit. 3.5.7.<note place="margin">Tit. 3.5.7.</note>

               <p>The inſtrumentall cauſes are of two ſorts: firſt on Gods part the word and the ſacraments, whereby the Lord offreth, conuaigheth, ſealeth, and aſſureth vnto vs his mercie &amp; grace, Chriſt Ieſus with his merites, righteouſneſſe, and obedience, the remiſſion of our ſinnes, and euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Secondly on our part a true and liuely faith, whereby wee receiue and apply vnto our ſelues the mercy of God, Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus &amp; all his benefits, reſting vpon him alone for our ſaluation.</p>

So that we are not iuſtified by the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall righteouſneſſe of the godhead, nor by our owne workes ioyned with Chriſts merites, nor by any inhaerent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes infuſed of God through the merites of Chriſt; or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing in our ſelues or any other meere creature, but by the alone righteouſneſſe of our mediatour Ieſus Chriſt God

                  <note place="margin">Of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall cauſe.</note>The formall cauſe of our iuſtification is a reciprocall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation or tranſmutation of the ſinnes of the beleeuer vnto Chriſt and of his righteouſneſſe vnto the beleeuer: whereby it commeth to paſſe that the faithfull man hath not his ſinnes imputed vnto him, nor the puniſhment due vnto them inflicted on him, becauſe Chriſt hath taken vpon him the guilt and puniſhment, and by making ful ſatisfaction vnto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers iuſtice, hath obtayned the pardon and remiſſion of al his ſinnes.

               <p>Thirdly and laſtly (becauſe it is my purpoſe onely to touch this point by the way as not ſo properly belonging to this treatiſe) wee are vnited vnto Chriſt Ieſus, and he is become our head and we his members, by reaſon of which vnion as he communicateth himſelfe vnto vs, ſo alſo that which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto him as he is our mediatour, and conſequently not onely his paſſiue obedience whereby he hath made full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our ſinnes, but alſo his actuall righteouſneſſe whereby he perfectly fulfilled the law.</p>
               <p>And thus it appeareth that our iuſtification conſiſteth of two parts, the firſt the remiſſion of our ſinnes for the full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Chriſt by his death and ſufferings, the other the imputation of his habituall and actiue righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>The remiſſion of ſinnes is the firſt part of iuſtification, whereby God forgiueth for the death and full ſatisfaction of Chriſt, all our ſinne both originall and actuall both in reſpect of the guilt and puniſhment, ſo as they ſhall neuer be imputed to our condemnation, neither in this life nor in the life to come.<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.1</note> And of this the pſalmiſt ſpeaketh, Pſal. 32.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe wickedneſſe is forgiuen, and whoſe ſinne is couered.</hi> 2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man vnto whom the Lorde imputeth not iniquitie.</hi> So the Apoſtle ſaith that <hi>God was in Chriſt, and reconciled the world to himſelfe not imputing their ſinnes vnto them.</hi>

               <p>The imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe is the other part of our iuſtification, whereby God imputeth vnto euery belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the righteouſneſſe of the mediatour Ieſus Chriſt as if it were properly their owne and perfourmed by them, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clothed therewith they may bee perfectly righteous in Gods ſight, and ſo obtaine the right vnto euerlaſting life and

               <p>Now this righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is twofold, his habituall and inhaerent holineſſe and innocencie, whereby he was free from all corruption and ſinne both originall and actuall; and indued with all holineſſe and puritie of nature, from the firſt moment of his conception. And of this the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. 2, Cor. 5.21. <hi>He that knew no ſinne, was made ſinne for vs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.21. 1. Pet. 2.22. Heb. 4.15.</note> and 1. Pet. 2.22. <hi>Who did no ſinne neither was there any guile found in his mouth.</hi> So Heb. 4.15.

The other is his actuall righteouſneſſe, whereby he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed perfect obedience vnto the law in all his thoughts, words, and deeds, through the whole courſe of his life. And this being imputed vnto vs, and becomming ours by reaſon of that vnion which is betweene Chriſt and vs, is oppoſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our actuall tranſgreſſion, whereby wee haue broken the whole law of God both in omitting the duties which are commaunded, and in committing the vices and ſinnes which are forbidden.</p>
               <p>The perſons who are thus iuſtified are all the faithful, and they onely who doe apply the righteouſneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt vnto themſelues by a true and liuely faith. And thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth limmitt and reſtraine it. Rom. 3.21.22.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.21.22. and 4.5.</note> Where hee ſaith that <hi>the righteouſneſſe of God is made manifeſt without the the law; to wit, the righteouſneſſe of God by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt,

His chiefe ſcope is to beate downe the pride of all, both Iewes and Gentiles to the end that the whole glory and praiſe of our iuſtification and ſaluation might be aſcribed to the free mercy, grace, and goodneſſe of God alone; now it is moſt certaine that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duties are in themſelues farre more excellent then the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall, and conſequently more fit to puffe vs vp with a ſpirituall pride, and to make vs to reſt in our ſelues for our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, aſcribing at leaſt ſome part of the praiſe vnto our owne workes and vertues; ſo that if the Apoſtle had onely ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the works of the ceremoniall law, mans pride ſhould not bee beaten downe, neither ſhould God haue the whole praiſe of our ſaluation, and ſo his diſcourſe ſhould be vaine, as not tending to prooue &amp; inforce that, for which end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hee chiefly vndertakes it.

<pb n="578" facs="tcp:23802:299"/>vs, but as it is the alone inſtrument whereby we doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend &amp; apply vnto vs Chriſt Ieſus, his righteouſneſſe &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, by which onely righteouſneſſe which is out of our ſelues in Chriſt as the proper ſubiect thereof, being offered in the word and Sacraments, and applied by faith we are iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Gods ſight,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.9.</note> as appeareth Phil. 2.9. Secondly whereas we ſay that faith alone iuſtifieth, we do not vnderſtand ſuch a faith, as is alone without workes, charitie, and other ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graces, which were nothing els but imaginarie dead, and but as it were a carkaſe of faith which breatheth not; but that amongſt all other graces, vertues &amp; faculties of the ſoule faith alone, and not any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the inſtrument whereby we apply Chriſt Ieſus vnto vs, who being thus applied doth iuſtifie vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That though workes do not iuſtifie vs yet they are neceſſarily required as fruits of our iuſtification.</note>Otherwiſe we affirme that other graces of Gods ſpirit and euen good workes which is a fruite of them all, doe neceſſarily acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany our iuſtification, not as inſtruments or cauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but as inſeparable effects and fruits thereof. So that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we exclude workes from the act of iuſtifying, yet wee neceſſarily require them in the ſubiect or perſon iuſtified; we affirme that faith alone iuſtifieth, but wee denie that ſuch a faith which is alone doth iuſtifie vs; we maintaine that we are iuſtified by faith alone without works, but with all we affirme that faith which is without workes doth not iuſtifie vs as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, falſe and imaginarie. This may bee made plaine by ſome ſimilitudes: to the being of an honeſt man there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required honeſt actions, not as cauſes but as effects, neither are his honeſt actions the cauſe of his honeſty, but his honeſty the cauſe of his honeſt actions; to a liuing man there is neceſſarily required as well breathing which is an action or effect of life, as the ſoule which is the cauſe thereof, and ſo to a iuſtified man there is neceſſarily required, as well good works which are the effects of iuſtification, as faith which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall cauſe thereof; for faith and workes are neuer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in the ſubiect or party iuſtified, although they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned in the act of iuſtifying. So the eye onely ſeeth and not the forehead, but yet the eye ſeuered from the forehead ſeeth not, becauſe it is but a dead eye, the hand writeth and not the
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:23802:299"/>body, but the hand ſeuered from the body writeth not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a dead hand. The foote goeth and not the head or heart, but the foote which is ſeuered from the head or heart goeth not, and ſo faith onely iuſtifieth, and not hope, not charitie, not workes, but the faith that is ſeuered from hope, charitie, and workes, iuſtifieth not, becauſe it is but a dead faith; as therefore when we ſay the eye onely ſeeth, the hand onely writeth, the foote onely walketh, our meaning is not that theſe parts being alone, and ſeuered from the reſt, ſee, write, and walke, but that amongſt all other parts, the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or function of ſeeing belongeth peculiarly vnto the eye, writing to the hand, walking to the foote: ſo when we ſay that onely faith iuſtifieth, our meaning is not that the faith which is alone, and ſeuered from other graces and the fruites of them good workes, iuſtifieth; but that amongſt all other graces this act of iuſtifying peculiarly and properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto faith, and not to any other grace, vertue; or workes.</p>

For the anſwering of which obiection we are to know, that this word imputing, or imputation, is taken two waies in the Scriptures: firſt when as the thing imputed is in our ſelues, and ſo it is ſaid Pſal. 106.31,<note place="margin">Pſal. 106.31.

If a man being poore and farre in debt ſhould be accounted and reputed exceeding rich and nothing indebted, it were indeede but a meere imagination.

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Rom. 5.1. Firſt therefore he ſuggeſteth that our iuſtification is an action of God, and therefore vnknowne to vs; ſo that we cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly attaine vnto any certaine knowledge that we are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of God, vnleſſe he aſſure vs hereof by ſome ſpeciall and extraordinarie reuelation.</p>
               <p>For the anſwering whereof, we are to vnderſtand that this act of God in iuſtifying a ſinner, is as cleerely reuealed ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily in the Scriptures, as any other thing concerning our ſaluation, and that euery true beleeuer may as certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude by vndoubted arguments grounded on Gods infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:23802:303"/>truth, that he is iuſtified before God, as by naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he can proue that he liueth and breatheth. For firſt our effectuall vocation and iuſtification are inſeparably linked together by the Apoſtle Rom. 8.30.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note> So that whoſoeuer can proue that he is effectually called, he may alſo moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly inferre that he is iuſtified. But euery true beleeuer may come to the certaine knowledge that he is effectually called (as before I haue ſhewed at large) and that not by any ſpeciall reuelation, but by the will of God, reuealed in his word by the inward teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit, and the vndoubted ſignes of effectuall calling, which he obſerueth in himſelfe; and therefore without any particular reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we may attaine vnto the aſſurance alſo that we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, that is, that our ſinnes are pardoned for the merits and full ſatiſfaction of Ieſus Chriſt, and we cloathed with his righteouſnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whoſoeuer can come to the aſſurance that he hath a true and liuely faith, he may alſo be aſſured that he is iuſtified; for it is the nature and an inſeparable propertie of true faith, to apply vnto the beleeuer Chriſt Ieſus and his righteouſneſſe, whereby hee is iuſtified before God; and hence it is that the Scriptures plainely affirme that we are iuſtified by faith and not by any thing elſe which is in vs, as before I haue ſufficiently ſhewed. But we may come to the certaine aſſurance that we haue a true faith, by the vndoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſignes and inſeparable fruites thereof, which wee may diſcerne in our ſelues (as hath been alreadie plainely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) though we neuer haue any ſpeciall reuelation: And therefore without any ſuch particular reuelation we may attaine vnto the certaine aſſurance that we are iuſtified in Gods ſight.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that which the Goſpell aſſureth vs of, we neede not to make any doubt thereof, or once call it into queſtion: but the Goſpell aſſureth vs, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in Chriſt Ieſus, and truely repent them of their ſinnes, ſhall be made partakers of all the gracious promiſes of life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation therein contained; So Ioh. 3.16.<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>God ſo loued the world that he hath giuen his onely begotten ſonne, that whoſoeuer
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:23802:304"/>beleeueth in him ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.</hi> And chap. 5.24.<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.24.</note> 
                  <hi>Verely, verely, I ſay vnto you, he that heareth my word and beleeueth him that ſent me, hath euerlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but hath paſſed from death to life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 11.28.</note> And Matth. 11.28. <hi>Come vnto me all ye that labour and are laden, and I will eaſe you.</hi> And therefore whoſoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Ieſus Chriſt, approuing their faith to the world and their owne conſciences, to bee true and vnfained, by the fruite thereof, vnfained repentance, he may aſſure himſelfe of all the gratious promifes of the Goſpell, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the remiſſion of his ſinnes, and his iuſtification for the merits and righteouſneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Lord hath not onely after a generall manner propounded theſe promiſes vnto vs, and left vs to our owne libertie to beleeue or not to beleeue them, but hee hath bound vs to the performance of this dutie by his expreſſe commaundement,<note place="margin">Mark. 1.15. 1.

And he that thus belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, needeth no other arguments to aſſure him that he is iuſtified and ſhall be ſaued; for he hath the witneſſe in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, euen the teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit, crying in his heart Abba father, and bearing witneſſe vnto his ſpirit that he is the childe of God: and not to beleeue this is to make God a lyer, becauſe wee <hi>will not beleeue the record that hee hath witneſſed of that his ſonne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 10.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. 1. Ioh. 5.10. Yea (as before I haue ſhewed at large) he hath added vnto the hand writing of his word, which containeth alſo his oath for our better confirmation, his ſacraments; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he particularly conuayeth and giueth vnto euery belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, as it were proper poſſeſſion of Chriſt Ieſus and all his benefits, to the end that there ſhould bee no place left to doubting, nor any neede of any particular reuelation, for our further aſſurance.</p>

               <p>To which we muſt anſwere, that indeede whoſoeuer is iuſtified is made iuſt, but not by infuſion of inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe into our ſelues, but by imputation of Chriſts moſt perfect righteouſneſſe, as before I haue ſhewed; for hereby our ſinnes are pardoned, he hauing taken them vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſatiſfied Gods iuſtice by ſuffering thoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which wee had deſerued; and alſo he hath perfectly fulfilled the law, that hee might make vs partakers of his actiue obedience; and ſo imputing both vnto vs, hath made vs perfectly iuſt and righteous in Gods ſight.</p>
               <p>So that now the Lord doth not require obedience to his law at our hands, to the end that wee ſhould be iuſtified in whole or in part, by our owne righteouſneſſe; neither are we to this end to obſerue Gods commandements, that we may offer vnto God our workes and inherent righteouſneſſe, deſiring thereby to be iuſtified; for, as I haue ſhewed, our beſt righteouſneſſe is imperfect, and mingled with manifold corruptions, ſo as it would rather condemne vs, then iuſtifie vs, if the Lord ſhould examine it according to the exact rule of his moſt perfect iuſtice: but we offer vnto God for our iuſtification, the moſt perfect righteouſneſſe and full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Ieſus Chriſt, which by his merits and ſufferings he hath once made for vs, deſiring thereby wholy and onely to be iuſtified and ſaued.</p>

               <p>And this is our ſanctification, which is expreſſed in the Scriptures by diuers names and phraſes; for it is called rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, the new birth, renouation, the putting off or morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:23802:306" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the old man, and the putting on or quickening of the new man and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>The efficient cauſe of our ſanctification is God himſelfe, who as he alone iuſtifieth vs and freeth vs from the guilt and puniſhment of ſinne, ſo he onely ſanctifieth vs and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs from the tyrannie of ſinne, ſo that it ſhall no longer raigne in our mortall bodies, freeing vs in ſuch meaſure as pleaſeth him from our naturall corruptions,<note place="margin">Leuit. 20.8.</note> which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wholy ouerſwayed vs. And this appeareth by plaine te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of holy Scriptures.<note place="margin">Iohn 1.13.</note> Iohn 1.13. It is ſaid that the faithfull are borne, <hi>not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ 2.10.</note> So Epheſ. 2.10. we are ſaid to be <hi>Gods workemanſhip, created in Christ Ieſus vnto good workes:</hi> which phraſe the Apoſtle vſeth to note vnto vs, that as God onely did create vs, ſo he onely doth renue and regenerate vs. The Lord likewiſe doth appropriate this worke vnto himſelfe as belonging to another. Ezech. 36.26.<note place="margin">Ezech. 36.26. and 34.28.</note> 
                  <hi>A new heart will I giue you, and a new ſpirit will I put into you, and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your body, and I will giue you an heart of fleſh.</hi> And hence it is that the Apoſtle deſiring the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Theſſalonians beggeth it at Gods hand, 1.

Pſalm. 51.10. <hi>Create in me a cleane heart O God, and renue a right ſpirit within me.</hi> So that as God doth begin in vs this worke of ſanctification, ſo likewiſe he doth accompliſh and finiſh it. And therefore as we are wholy to aſcribe vnto God our election, vocation and iuſtification, ſo alſo our ſanctification, that he may be all in all in the worke of our ſaluation. For as he onely formed vs, ſo he onely can reforme vs, as he is the author of our naturall generation,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.28.</note> for by his bleſſing we haue our being, ſo alſo of our ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, for by his ſpirit onely wee are renued. Neither muſt we imagine that it is in mans power to renew himſelfe, no more than to beget himſelfe: for as well may the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moore change his skinne, or the Leopard his ſpots, as wee doe good who are accuſtomed to doe euill,<note place="margin">Ierem. 13.23.</note> Ierem. 13.23. yea, as eaſily may the dead man raiſe himſelfe, as wee may

               <p>But here it may be demaunded, that if ſanctification bee wholie the worke of God, and not in our owne power, why doe the Scriptures exhort vs to ſanctifie our ſelues, to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our ſinnes, and to walke in newneſſe of life? I anſwere, that though ſanctification bee wholy from God, yet theſe exhortations are neceſſarie; for hee worketh this worke in vs, not as in ſtocks and ſtones, but as in reaſonable creatures, of whom he requireth conſent of will, deſire and endeuour in the vſe of the meanes ordained of God, for the beginning and perfecting of this worke of ſanctification in vs. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this will, deſire, and endeuour, be his work likewiſe, yet theſe exhortations to godlineſſe are to good purpoſe; for with the exhortation God ioyneth the operation of his ſpirit, and whileſt he commandeth vs, he giueth power alſo to performe that which he commandeth; whileſt he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs to ſanctification, hee himſelfe ſanctifieth vs with his ſpirit.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> 
                  <hi>that our old man is crucified with him, that the bodie of ſinne might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, that hencefoorth we ſhould not ſerue ſinne.</hi> Secondly, by vertue of his buriall, this death of ſinne is as it were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continued, and thereby our ſinnes and corruptions are more and more ſubdued and kept vnder, that they cannot riſe and rebel againſt the ſpirit.

And therefore whoſoeuer would bee aſſured that he hath attained true ſanctification, he is to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to compoſe and frame the whole man, his minde and imagination, his will and affections, his outward actions, life and conuerſation, according to the exact rule of Gods law: in all of them mortifying the old man, and his inbred corruption, and imbracing the contrarie duties of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. Otherwiſe if our ſanctification be not of the whole man, and euery part in their ſeuerall meaſure, it will in the end be vaine and fruitleſſe; for as it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for citizens being beſieged, to fortifie one place of the wall, and leaue another part vnfortified, or to keepe ſtrait watch at ſome of the gates and leaue others open; ſo it will not auaile vs to fortifie ſome parts againſt the power of ſinne, and to leaue others weake and naked, nor to garde ſome of the outward paſſages of the ſenſes, and neglecting ſome other, ſuffer them to lie as an open entrance to let in
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:23802:310"/>our ſpirituall enemies, for ſo they will eaſily ſurpriſe vs, and leade vs captiue vnto ſinne; but if we would be in any ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in this ſtrait ſiege, we muſt ſet a ſtrong garde, and a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full watch, ouer euery part and facultie of our bodies and ſoules.</p>

                  <hi>wherein the ſpirit of God applying vnto vs the vertue and power of Chriſts death and buriall, doth by little and little weaken, ſubdue, and kill in vs our naturall corruption, the fleſh and the luſts thereof, ſo that they are not ſo powrfull as in times paſt to ſtirre vp in our mindes euill motions which are contrarie to the will and word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this deſcription is ſet downe firſt the cauſe of our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, which is the vertue and efficacie of Chriſts death and buriall,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.4.5.</note> communicated and applied vnto vs by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, whereby wee are ingrafted into the body of Chriſt, and ſo made partakers of the power and vertue of Chriſts death, which being deriued vnto vs, doth not onely take away the guilt and puniſhment of ſinne, but alſo doth mortifie and kill our naturall corruptions, which heretofore wholy ruled and ouerſwaied vs. Secondly, the forme man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and progreſſe of this worke is here expreſſed, namely, the weakning, ſubduing, and killing of our corruption by little and little; ſo that this worke is not perfected at once, and in an inſtant, but by degrees: firſt it is weakned and the power thereof ſomewhat abated, ſo as though it beare ſway in vs, yet it doth not wholy ouerrule vs without reſiſtance,
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:23802:312"/>as it was vſed to doe in the time of our ignorance: then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further enabled by vertue of Gods ſpirit, working in vs, we preuaile againſt it, ſo that though it often rebell, yet doe we ſubdue it and obtaine victorie. Laſtly obtaining a greater meaſure of the ſpirit, we mortifie and kill it; that is, though we doe not vtterly depriue it of life and motion, yet we giue it ſuch a deadly wound that it neuer recouereth his former ſtrength, but ſtill pineth and languiſheth, till with the death of the bodie it alſo dieth and is wholy aboliſhed. Now whileſt it is in this conſumption and neere vnto death, hauing a long time before been weake, oftentimes it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to recouer ſtrength, and to offer ſome violence vnto the regenerat part: but this muſt not diſcourage vs, as though now it were on the mending hand, and like to be reſtored to it former health and ſtrength: for as it fareth with thoſe that lie vpon their deathbead; ſo it is with our ſicke fleſh, and the corruptions thereof, after that nature ſeemeth ſpent, and the power thereof wholy decayed, oftentimes falling into ſome grieuous fit, wherein there is a fight betweene life and death, their ſtrength ſeemeth redoubled and farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than euer it was: but bee of good comfort, it is no ſigne of health, but a pange of death which neare approacheth.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee the death of ſinne and our naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.

Conſider likewiſe that thy God is moſt mercifull, and therefore ſtill ready to pardon thy ſinnes; and the rather, becauſe he knoweth thy fraile weakeneſſe in reſiſting ſinne, and inability to performe obedience to his lawe: and alſo that Chriſt died, not for the iuſt but the vniuſt, not for the righteous, but for the ſinner: and therefore be thy ſinnes neuer ſo many, yet applying the merits of Chriſt by faith, neither their guilt nor puniſhment ſhall be imputed vnto thee. Call to minde alſo the gracious promiſes of pardon and forgiueneſſe, which are made vnto thee in the Goſpell; for the obtaining whereof, nothing is required of thee but faith and repentance: now this faith thou haſt already, and this repentance thou maiſt haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after when thou haſt inioyed the pleaſure or profit of this ſinne.

For the Lord is immutable and vnchangeable in his courſe of iuſtice, and he hateth ſinne now as deadly as in former ages; neither will he ſpare vs more than others, if we liue in our ſinnes without repentance: nay certainly as our ſinnes being ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauated by many circumſtances are more odious vnto him, ſo will the Lord proportionably inflict more heauie iudgements vpon vs then he hath vpon others, whoſe ſinnes haue not been ſo great and preſumptuous. For if the Lord giue vs now extraordinarie knowledge, or at leaſt the meanes thereof, and we ſinne againſt this knowledge and againſt our owne conſciences; if he hath in moſt abundant meaſure, multiplied his mercies vpon vs, and we hereby be made more vnkind and vngratefull; if he hath giuen vs warning by innumerable examples of his heauie iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments executed vpon others in former times, and in our own daies, yea euen in our owne ſight, layeth heauie puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon ſuch as haue committed no other ſinnes then wee our ſelues are guiltie of, and yet wee continue in our ſinnes without repentance, how is it poſſible but that wee ſhould prouoke Gods fierce wrath againſt vs, and draw downe violently vpon our ſelues with theſe cartropes of iniquitie, Gods fearefull plagues and heauie iudgements.

<pb n="625" facs="tcp:23802:322"/>that God wil ſtrengthen thee with his ſpirit, which thou haſt a long time reſiſted and vexed, by quenching the good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof; thou haſt now no ſhew of hope to effect that which thou deſireſt; and therefore it were much better for thee to ceaſe ſtriuing againſt the ſtreame of thy corruptions, and to follow the naturall current of thy deſires: for when thou takeſt all the paines thou canſt, thou art in one day ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried further backward toward thine old conuerſation, than thou canſt in many moneths get forward in the courſe of ſanctification.</p>

The one remembreth his ſinnes which he hath committed, with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and reioycing, yea bragging and boaſting of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious wickedneſſe; the other neuer thinketh vpon them but with griefe and ſorrow, neither is there any thing in the world whereof he is more aſhamed than of his ſinnes. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore there is ſuch great and manifold differences, betweene the ſinnes of the ſanctified and thoſe who are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified,
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:23802:332"/>let not Sathan perſwade vs that wee are ſtill in the fleſh and vnregenerate, becauſe will we nill we, we often fall into ſinne, if in our manner of ſinning wee can finde theſe differences which we neuer diſcerned in former times.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd ſo much concerning thoſe temptations which Sathan ſuggeſteth in reſpect of our ſinnes in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: now we are to ſpeake of ſuch as concerne particular ſinnes, and theſe are of two ſorts; for either Sathan ſeeketh to ouerthrow our faith, and to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage vs from going forward in our courſe of godlineſſe, by ſetting before vs and exceedingly aggrauating thoſe ſinnes which indeede wee haue committed, or by perſwading vs falſely that we haue committed ſuch ſinnes, as being vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable are not incident to the childe of God. The former ſort of temptations are taken either from ſome hainous ſin once committed, or from the often falling into the ſame ſin. Concerning the firſt, he aggrauateth the ſinnes of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full two eſpeciall waies, either becauſe they haue been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after repentance, or voluntarily againſt knowledge and conſcience. In the former reſpect he is ready to ſuggeſt, that the children of God doe not commit any ſinne after they haue truly repented of it; and if any doe, either he neuer truly repented, or if he did, yet after his fall there is no place to a ſecond repentance, nor hope of Gods mercie. For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering whereof wee are to know, that howſoeuer the ſtate of thoſe who thus ſinne is ſomewhat dangerous, and they more hardly recouered than others (euen as thoſe diſeaſes are perilous and hardly cured, into which wee fall by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe after the recouerie of health) yet this is incident to the children of God who haue truly repented, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this grieuous kinde of falling they are not debarred of Gods mercie in Chriſt Ieſus. And this appeareth partly by
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:23802:333"/>reaſons, and partly by examples. For firſt, the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpell concerning the remiſſion of ſinnes, are indefinite and without limitation, of time, or ſinnes, whether committed before or after repentance. So Matth. 11.28. <hi>Come vnto me all ye that labour and are heauie laden,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 11.28. 1. Ioh. 2.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and I will eaſe you:</hi> and 1. Iohn 2.1, 2. <hi>If any man ſinne, we haue an aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the father, &amp;c.</hi> In which and in many other places, the Lord aſſureth vs that he will receiue to mercy all repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſinners, of what nature and qualitie ſoeuer their ſinnes are. Secondly, in the lawe were ſacrifices appoynted for the ſinnes of the people, not onely thoſe who were newly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the Lords couenant for their ſinnes paſt, but alſo for thoſe ſinnes which were daily committed, after that they had long been therein. Thirdly, the Lord inoyneth vs that we forgiue our brother ſeuentie times ſeuen times, if ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hee offend vs and repent of his fault; and therefore himſelfe much more, whoſe mercy is infinite, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth ours than the whole ſea a little droppe, will pardon vs if as we often ſinne, ſo alſo wee often turne vnto him by vnfained repentance. This alſo manifeſtly appeareth by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, for did not the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> after his true conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion fall grieuouſly by committing murther and adulterie, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> by denying his Lord and Sauiour, <hi>Noah</hi> by drunkenneſſe, <hi>Lot</hi> by inceſt, and yet afterwards they tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repented againe and were receiued to mercy? So that this poynt is cleere and manifeſt, that the deare childe of God, after his true conuerſion and vnfained repentance may fall into grieuous ſinnes, and yet truly repenting of them, may haue them remitted, and bee receiued againe into Gods wonted loue and fauour.</p>

                  </note> But here the tempter will obiect that the Apoſtle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Heb. 6.4, 5, 6. <hi>That it is impoſſible that thoſe who haue been once inlightened, &amp;c. if they fall away, ſhould be renewed by repentance: ſeeing by ſo ſinning, they crucifie againe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the Sonne of God, and make a mocke of him.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſoeuer ſinneth after his true conuerſion, can neither repent nor receiue mercy. To which we muſt anſwere, that the Apoſtle in this place doth not ſpeake of euery falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:23802:333"/>to ſinne, for ſo he ſhould be contrary to the other Scriptures before alledged, but of a generall falling away by apoſtaſie, and of a malitious perſecuting of the knowne truth, which is the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, the which is ioyned with continuall impenitency, and therefore cannot be pardoned. And this appeareth manifeſtly by the words of the text; for he doth not ſimply ſay if he fall into ſinne, but if he fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, namely by a generall and malitious apoſtaſie: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he ſheweth of what manner of falling he meaneth in the words following, whereas he ſaith, that ſuch as thus fall away, crucifie vnto themſelues the ſonne of God, and make a mocke of him. Now they are ſaid to crucifie Chriſt againe, who with an vnplacable hatred doe ſcorne and deride Chriſt crucified, renouncing all part and hope in his death and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as did ſome of the malitious Iewes, and as ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates doe in theſe dayes. And therefore this place ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing againſt the repentance and receiuing to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of ſuch as fall through infirmitie into ſome particular ſinnes, though neuer ſo hainous.</p>

For the anſwering vnto which temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, we are to knowe theſe two things; firſt, that all ſinnes committed againſt knowledge and conſcience are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous: ſecondly, that though we ſhould fall into pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinnes, yet we may be the children of God, who are neither debarred of true repentance nor of Gods mercy. For the firſt, we are to know that not the hainouſneſſe of the ſinne committed maketh it to bee preſumptuous, but the manner of the fact, and the minde of the offender; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer <hi>Peter</hi> fell grieuouſly, yet we cannot ſay that hee fell preſumptuouſly,<note place="margin">VVhat it is to ſinne preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly.</note> becauſe he ſinned through infirmitie and feare of danger, whereas to ſinne preſumptuouſly, is to ſinne
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:23802:334"/>of a ſtubborne wilfulneſſe, either through the neglect of Gods iuſtice and iudgements, or through the abuſe of his mercy and benefits. In the firſt reſpect they offend, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing diuers times themſelues ſinned, and yet eſcaped pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or hauing ſeene others in the like caſe, doe take occaſion hereby to ſinne againe, hoping to eſcape as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times: and of ſuch the wiſe man ſpeaketh, Eccleſ. 8.11, <hi>Becauſe ſentence against an euill worke is not executed ſpeedily,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.11.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore the heart of the children of men is fully ſet in them to doe euill.</hi> In the other reſpect, ſuch offend as take occaſion vpon Gods mercy and long ſuffering to fall into ſinne, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming before they commit it, that God vpon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance will in his infinite mercy forgiue them: and thus they abuſe Gods mercy and goodneſſe which ſhould leade them to repentance, as an argument to make them more deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately to runne into all wickedneſſe.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.4.</note> So that to ſinne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly, is not to ſinne vpon knowledge, and againſt a mans conſcience onely, vnleſſe there be ioyned therewith a preſumptuous hope to eſcape puniſhment, or that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſinne committed, he ſhall receiue pardon in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Gods infinite mercy. Now many of Gods children may fall againſt their knowledge and conſcience, and yet not preſume either to eſcape Gods iudgements or to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his mercy, as namely thoſe who are caried head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into a ſinne without any time of deliberation through the violence of their corruptions, or ouercome by feare of ſome preſent danger, or ſome other vnruly paſſion.</p>

<pb n="649" facs="tcp:23802:334"/>ſinnes againſt knowledge are pardonable vpon true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but euen horrible blaſphemies againſt the maieſtie of God, yea, all ſinnes whatſoeuer ſauing the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt. Matth. 12.31, 32. Secondly,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.31, 32.</note> we knowe by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that both <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> fell grieuouſly againſt their knowledge and conſcience, wittingly, and in a ſort wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and yet they both repented and were receiued to mercie: and therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not of all kinde of voluntary falling, but firſt of ſinne committed with full conſent of will, pleaſure, and delight: the which kinde of ſinnes are neuer committed by Gods children after their true conuerſion; for as they are in part carnall and vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſo are they in part ſpirituall and regenerate, which is to be vnderſtoode; not onely of the vnderſtanding part, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the will and affections. So farre forth therefore as their will is regenerate, they doe not will nor yeeld vnto ſinne; and though they conſent vnto ſinne, yet this conſent is not abſolute and intire, but with ſome diſlike, grudging, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the ſpirituall part; the which diſlike and reſiſtance, though ſometimes it cannot eaſily be diſcerned in the very act of ſinne, whereas the weake motions of the ſpirit are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ouerborne, through the violent ſtrength of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall corruptions, and ſo ouerſhadowed by the cloudie miſts which their vnruly paſſions caſt before their vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that they cannot at all perceiue any diſlike or reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance againſt the temptation: yet after the ſinne is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the good motions of the ſpirit are againe reuiued out of their deadly ſwound, then doe they hate and deteſt that ſinne which before ſeemed pleaſant vnto them and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire with the Apoſtle to be freed from it. Laſtly, the Apoſtle in that place doth not ſpeake of euery particular ſinne committed with full conſent of will, for ſo alſo the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect offend before their conuerſion, but of a generall and malitious apoſtaſie from the knowne truth, and a ſcornefull reiecting of the ſacrifice of Chriſt once offered for ſinne: ſo that the ſenſe is thus much, that if wee wilfully and maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſinne, by renouncing the ſacrifice of Chriſt offered for ſinne, we cannot hope to be ſaued by any other ſacrifice, but
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:23802:335"/>are to expect iudgement and condemnation, ſeeing ſuch treade vnder foote the ſonne of God, and count the blood of the teſtament an vnholy thing, and euen deſpite the ſpirit of grace, as he explaneth himſelfe in the verſes following.</p>

For the firſt, though it muſt needes bee confeſſed that it is a fearefull caſe, to neglect Gods iuſtice and iudgements becauſe of his long ſuffering, or to take occaſion vpon the abundance of Gods mercies and readineſſe to forgiue, to prouoke him continually by our ſinnes; yet it cannot be denied, but that a true chriſtian, through the ſtrength of his inbred corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may fall into theſe preſumptuous ſinnes; neither is there any priuiledge in the holy Scriptures to exempt them from any ſinne whatſoeuer, but that either before or after their conuerſion they may fall into it, ſauing onely that vnpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſinne which is committed againſt the holy Ghoſt. Moreouer, <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth the Lord to keepe him from <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinnes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm. 19.13.</note> and that he would not ſuffer them <hi>to raigne ouer him,</hi> Pſalm. 19.13. where firſt he ſheweth that of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he was apt to fall into ſuch ſinnes, if the Lord did not preſerue him from them; and ſecondly he implieth, that the Lord might for good cauſes knowne vnto himſelfe, ſuffer him to commit theſe ſinnes of preſumption, and therefore he further prayeth that if hee ſhould fall into ſuch ſinnes, it would pleaſe the Lord to raiſe him by true repentance, and not ſuffer them to rule and raigne in him. So that it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that a true chriſtian may fall into theſe ſinnes: now, that hauing fallen he may riſe againe by true repentance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue pardon and forgiueneſſe, it is likewiſe manifeſt. For if once the Lord receiue vs into the couenant of grace, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge vs for his children, then nothing in the world, no not the moſt grieuous ſinnes which we can fall into, can ſeparate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.38, 39.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Rom. 8.38, 29. Secondly, our Sauiour telleth vs, that <hi>euery ſinne and blaſphemy ſhall be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto men</hi> vpon true repentance,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.31.32.</note> ſauing onely the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie

Thirdly, the promiſes of the the Goſpell are generall and indefinit, excluding no fortes of ſinnes whatſoeuer, ſo they performe the condition of faith and repentance. And therefore alſo preſumptuous ſinners, repenting and beleeuing, are aſſured of mercie and forgiueneſſe. Laſtly, if <hi>Dauid</hi> might fall into theſe ſinnes, then <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo might repent and receiue pardon, ſeeing he was truely iuſtified, ſanctified, and a choſen veſſell of the Lord elected to euerlaſting life.</p>

For the anſwering whereof we are to know, that in truth it is a grieuous and fearefull caſe to be thus ouertaken, and to be ſo beſotted with the pleaſures of ſinne, that neither inſtruction nor our owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience can make vs to ſee the euils of ſinne, and worke in vs a care to auoyde and ſhunne it. The burnt childe (as the prouerbe is) dreadeth the fire; he that hath been deceiued and thereby much indamaged, is afterwards more warie; he that hath caſt himſelfe into any grieuous diſeaſe through ſome vnholeſome meates, is euer after more carefull of his diet; he that hath once been aſſaulted by his enemie at vnawares, and hath receiued grieſly woundes, will after he is cured goe better armed and furniſhed, that he may not againe be ouertaken of the like daunger. And therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing experience of all other euils doth teach vs to auoyde them, what a lamentable thing is this, that no warning will make vs take heede of ſinne, which is the greateſt euill and
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:23802:336"/>cauſe of all the reſt? that hauing drunke this deadly poyſon and been grieuouſly ſicke thereof in our conſciences, wee ſhould being recouered be inticed with the pleaſant taſte thereof to ſwallow it downe againe? and that hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued grieuous wounds, we ſhould after take no better heede, and goe no better armed and prepared to make reſiſtance, but for want of care and watchfulneſſe expoſe our ſelues againe to the like daunger of our ſpirituall enemies? But yet we are to know that this ſometimes,<note place="margin">That the child of God may fall often into the ſame ſinne and yet be receiued to mercie.</note> through our great frailtie and corruption, may be the eſtate of a true chriſtian and faithfull ſeruant of God, to fall againe and againe into the ſame ſinne, neither doth any thing priuiledge them from committing that ſinne againe which they haue once committed. For firſt the ſame inbred corruption ſtill dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in them and is readie againe to giue them the foyle and to leade them captiue into the ſame ſinne, if the Lord vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them not, ſo that inreſpect of their owne ſtrength they may fall againe as in former times. Secondly, the ſame cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſtill remaine which may moue the Lord to leaue them to themſelues, and ſuffer them to fall, namely that hereby they may be more humbled, and more ſeriouſly bewaile their corruptions, that they may more earneſtly implore his mercie, and he more manifeſt it in pardoning their ſinnes to the praiſe of his glorie. Thirdly, howſoeuer this is not vſuall with the children of God, to fall diuers times into, a ſinne which is great and grieuous, yet euery one findeth in his owne experience that he often committeth ſuch ſinnes as are not ſo heynous, through infirmitie and weakneſſe; as to heare the word negligently and careleſſely, to be diſtracted with wandering thoughts in prayer, to fall into vniuſt anger, to lie and vſe idle communication and ſuch like, of which notwithſtanding repenting he is receiued vnto mercie. So that it is not the often falling into the ſame ſinne, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth vs out of the number of Gods children, or debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs of pardon, ſo that we often repent lay holde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt with a liuely faith. Neither do the ſcriptures limit and reſtraine Gods mereie, and the vertue of Chriſts merits, to the pardoning and taking away of diuers ſinnes, once
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:23802:336"/>committed, but extend them alſo to the ſame ſinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted diuers times, yea to all ſinnes whatſoeuer of which we truely repent.</p>

For the queſtion is, whether the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full may be aſſured of their perſeuerance in faith, whether a member of Chriſt may be aſſured to continue a member of Chriſt, whether a ſheepe of Chriſt may aſſure himſelfe that he is to remaine for euer a ſheepe of Chriſt; we hold the affirmatiue part and proue it by diuers teſtimonies; they deny that theſe promiſes are abſolute, but on this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we are aſſured none can plucke vs from Chriſt, ſo long as we continue and retaine the nature of the members and ſheepe of Chriſt. But I would faine know what it is to be plucked from Chriſt, but to ceaſe to bee a member or ſheepe of Chriſt, and to looſe their nature: and what it is to be a ſheepe of Chriſt but to heare his word and to follow him. When as then our Sauiour Chriſt promiſeth that none ſhall plucke his ſheepe from him, he promiſeth that none ſhall be able to make them ceaſe to be his ſheepe, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue them of their nature which is the eſſentiall forme which maketh them to be ſheepe, rather than other who neither heare his word nor follow him. Whereas therefore they affirme, that theſe promiſes doe aſſure vs to perſeuere, ſo long as we continue and retaine the nature of the ſheepe and members of Chriſt, what is it but idly to repeate the ſame thing? namely that Gods promiſes doe aſſure vs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere, ſo long as wee doe perſeuere; that we ſhall not be plucked from Chriſt ſo long as we remaine with Chriſt; that
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:23802:346"/>we ſhall continue the members and ſheepe of Chriſt, ſo long as we continue to be his ſheepe and members; that we ſhall not looſe our faith ſo long as we continue faithfull. And what is it to ſay that the ſheepe of Chriſt ſhall ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be his ſheepe as they retaine their nature, but to graunt alſo that they may looſe their nature, &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceaſe to be Chriſts ſheepe, and ſo be plucked from him which is quite contrarie to his promiſe?</p>
